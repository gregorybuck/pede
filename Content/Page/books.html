    (Don Edgar, 2005, Melbourne University  Press)</p>
        <p>
        <img alt="War Over Work" src="Content/images/img_waroverwork.jpg" style="height:100px;"/> 
        </p>
    <p>
        A bold account of current and future work patterns and the labour market in Australia - a battleground between corporate greed and private need, unions and employers, men and women, old and  young. 
        Don Edgar argues that we  cannot continue to focus on the 'work-family balance' as though it can be  achieved through simple programs within individual Australian workplaces. 
        <em>The War Over Work</em> offers a blueprint for  how we can win the war to get a life that works for all.<br />

    <p><strong>The Patchwork Nation: Rethinking  government, </strong><br />
    <strong>rebuilding community</strong><br />
    (Don Edgar, 2001, Harper Collins)
    </p>
        <p>
        <img alt="The Patchwork Nation" src="Content/images/img_thepatchworknation.jpg" style="height:100px;"/> 
    </p>
    <p>
        In <em>The Patchwork Nation,</em> Don Edgar argues that in response to dramatic worldwide changes in the  workplace, family and community life, 
        a 'new tribalism' based on fear and  inequality has developed in Australia.  This new tribalism can only be countered by a total revamp 
        of how we are  governed. It means an end to top-down, one-size-fits-all management. We need a  more locally-responsive approach to schools, 
        skills training and community  support systems. And we need a new business ethic which has human and social  values as its basis, rather than 
        focusing on profit alone. His vision for the  future is one of a patchwork nation; bound by loose ties, this nation would be  connected by a government 
        sensitive to diverse regional needs, and by  community-building based on a more direct democratic approach to  decision-making and the 'delivery' 
        of services.<br />

    <p><strong>&nbsp;Men, Mateship, Marriage: Exploring macho</strong><br />

        </p>
    <p>Being  a man in modern-day Australia  is a complicated task. The last few decades have seen enormous changes in our  society and the accompanying cultural 
    shifts have drastically affected how men  and women relate to each other. Drawing on large-scale research studies on  marriage and the family, 
    <em>Men, Mateship, Marriage</em> finds that for most Australian men  their 'best mate' is usually their wife and that the family is, 
    contrary to  popular rumour, not disintegrating. This book is a  quiet reclamation, even a quiet celebration, of male-female mateship,  marriage and the family, 
    showing that despite new challenges we can, by  transforming our personal relationships, we have the power to transform society  itself.<br />

        Patricia Edgar (Sun  Books, 1979) <br />
        A  controversial critique of the  press as our supposed bulwark  against oppression, in  a nation where monopoly control  is more complete than<br />
        in  any country in the Western World other than the Republic of Eire. <br />
        The  book's thesis is based on historic interviews with  Australian journalists, editors and senior executives about  their coverage (with<br />
        content  analysis) of the Whitlam  Government's dismissal in  1975. The book provoked defensive  editorial comment from  The Age and The Herald and equally strong<br />
        debate  from researchers and commentators including Donald  Horne, and  Professor Henry Mayer.</p>
