    <p>The history of children's television in Australia  over the past 40 years represents a case study in how to bring about change in  the broadcasting system.&nbsp; Television was  introduced to Australia  in 1956.&nbsp; Every government report on  television over the next 25 years expressed deep concern about children's  television.&nbsp; We did not know what is  known now about brain development, but as a teacher who had a passion for film,  I resented the fact that there were no Australian stories on Australian  television, especially for children.</p>
    <p>Reform came about when the government decided in 1976, to  set up an enquiry into self regulation for broadcasters.&nbsp; This was a conservative Government which  supported the commercial television interests. The Government was philosophically  disposed to de-regulation and self-regulation but the public response took them  by surprise.</p>
    <p>More than 500 submissions argued the case before the  Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's enquiry that television should be regulated  to ensure quality and ensure there was Australian programming for  children.&nbsp; The concerns expressed related  to the content of the programs, the lack of programs designed especially for  children, the poor quality of the few that were, the high number of repeats,  the amount of foreign material shown, the nature of advertising directed  to&nbsp; children, and the exploitation of  children through the commercialisation of characters in their programs.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The public airing of these issues before the Broadcasting  Tribunal contributed to the industry's and the government's awareness of the  extent of public dissatisfaction with children's television and strengthened  the Tribunal's resolve to act.&nbsp; A  Children's Program Committee (CPC) was formed and given the responsibility for  drawing up guidelines for children's programs and advertising directed to  children as well as classifying programs specifically designed for them.&nbsp; I was appointed to chair that committee and  was chair for five years, during which time we devised Standards and set up  systems to classify programs.</p>
    <p>The Australian experience provides a case study of a long  and often bitter dispute and demonstrates just how difficult it is to bring  about change in a commercial broadcasting system. Nevertheless the broadcasting  regulator and the public interest prevailed with the government introducing  legislation to implement quotas for children's programs.&nbsp; This legislation has been reviewed a number  of times over the past 30 years and the Broadcasting Administrator - now called  the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) &nbsp;has changed four times. The Children's  Standards are undergoing a further review this year to allow for the impact of  new media.</p>
    <p>When the Standards were first introduced in 1978 much of the  debate revolved around the definition of a children's program. The guidelines  called for Australian drama, documentaries, magazine and informational programs  designed specifically for children. They stressed programs should not be  didactic, instructional and overtly educational but must first be entertaining  television and about subjects which interest children, designed and presented  in such a way that they could be readily understood and appreciated by  children. They were not to be family programs for a general audience.</p>
    <p>As with all regulation, the regulated tend to find ways  around the rules.&nbsp; Less  than three years after the C classification was introduced the stations devised  a formula to meet the regulatory requirements which included a half-hour of  magazine programming and a high number of repeats of Australian and overseas  programs; there was little diversity and <strong>no</strong> new Australian drama - the most important programming in my Committee's view  -was being produced.&nbsp; The networks were  simply not interested in trying to succeed with children's programming.</p>
    <p>Instead they were so outraged by the Standards and the  attempt (as they saw it) to restrict their unfettered commercial approach to  programming that they challenged the legality of the Standards in the Federal  Court as soon as they were implemented. They lost so they took the battle to  the High Court which declared that children's drama standards were  invalid.&nbsp; In view of the High Court's  decision the Government moved quickly and introduced an Amendment Bill  strengthening the Broadcasting Television Act and affirming the Tribunal's  powers. </p>
    <p>There was always going to be tension between the networks  and the regulator as the Tribunal sought to impose a policy for children's  television really recquiring the development of programs that entertained but  had a serious well developed cultural purpose.&nbsp;  An aggressive network would minimise their costs and stretch their  audience focus as widely as they could.</p>
    <p>The children's programming initiatives by the Australian  Government were unique in the world; the fashionable approach to broadcasting  regulation was deregulation. It was because of the strong public support for  better children's television which was clear to Government that these reforms  came about.</p>
    <p>Once the Standards were enshrined clearly in legislation,  the challenge facing the Children's Program Committee was to find the type of  program the legislation was designed to achieve. Angry that they had lost their  argument in Court the Networks were not going to produce them. Their argument  became that they didn't know what a children's drama looked like and that no  one in Australia  was equipped to produce such programs anyway. So the Networks, opposed to the  regulations they saw as reducing their profit margins, but required by law to  provide programs, sat and waited to see what the independent industry could  come up with. There was no funding base to encourage the creation of quality  children's programs and no institutional base to recruit writers, directors and  producers to work in the production field.</p>
    <p>To try to find a way around these major issues a number of  people gathered for an initial meeting. We decided to use the International  Year of the Child 1979 as a platform to build a Children's Television  Foundation which would produce model programs to demonstrate the child audience  would watch these programs and they could be successful.</p>
    <p>Again there was much politicking which led to a report where  all States and Commonwealth Governments agreed in principle to set up an  Australian Children's Television Foundation. The Working Party's Report  recognized that legislative or regulatory action alone was not achieving the  required improvements in children's television which were hoped for. Had the  industry not taken the belligerent path they took we would have reached our  goal more easily and that is for others to learn from.</p>
    <p>The report from the Ministers of Education around the  country concluded:<br />
        &ldquo;a substantial improvement in the  quality and quantity of children's television programming required the spending  of a large amount of money.&nbsp; No  significant improvement in the quality of children's television programs would  be achieved unless a massive effort was made by Governments, the Networks and  other funding sources to cooperate in meeting this challenge.&nbsp; The most cost effective way of tackling the  problem, and the only way likely to achieve the required breakthrough, was to  set up a new organization, an independent body with a national identity, owing  allegiance to no commercial interest, which was capable of earning the respect of  all parties because of its constructive approach.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Foundation's major function was to  encourage the development of production and transmission of children's programs  of quality.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>It would do this by: developing writers, directors and  producers to work in children's programming; raising finance from government  sponsors and other sources for investment in the production of high quality  children's television programs; entering into joint investment arrangements for  production; sponsoring and conducting research into all areas relevant to  children's television; promoting mass media education; marketing programs in  which the Foundation had a financial interest.</p>
    <p>The Foundation was incorporated as a Company Limited by  Guarantee funded by government and private sources, but independent and able to  act on a commercial basis.&nbsp; It reported  to all States and Territories in Australia.&nbsp; The Foundation would not be a production&nbsp; house with  studio facilities but an initiator and broker of production with the independent  industry with the power to commission&nbsp;  projects it initiated itself.</p>
    <p>We were very clear on the purpose of the Foundation: it was  to produce top-quality Australian children's television and to contribute to a  sense of national identity for young viewers. It would be child and program  oriented.&nbsp; It was not there to provide  work opportunities and create jobs for the industry. The Foundation was not  bent on improving television around the world, just at home.&nbsp; I cannot pretend that any of this was easy</p>
    <p>I became Founding Director of the Australian Children's  Television Foundation and over a 20 year period the Foundation developed an  Australian children's production industry which made programs that were  successful by any criteria. Most importantly the programs worked with the  audience for which they were intended.&nbsp;  We told Australian stories to Australian children; they saw themselves  on television and it is difficult to measure the impact and the self-esteem a  generation feels when they know they have cultural relevance.</p>
    <p>The programs were successful critically as evidenced by the  number of awards they won. We created an international market for Australian  programs; our drama series sold to more than 100 countries around the world.  This was a by-product - not our main purpose - but a very beneficial  by-product.</p>
    <p>The ACTF demonstrated a new direction and depth for  children's television.&nbsp; All programs told  stories with three-dimensional characters; they showed the diversity of social  groups in Australia.&nbsp; We created new heroes and allowed them to  make mistakes, like real people we know, not like Hollywood  stars.&nbsp; We told stories about characters  who grew through the resolution of conflict and experience.&nbsp; Boys and girls were character leads in the  stories; adults were seen to change and be imperfect at times.&nbsp; We raised ethical questions, giving a sense  that there is not always a clear right or wrong answer, that anger in itself is  not always bad, and that violence has consequences.&nbsp; We showed that women had as much moral and  social responsibility as men, and that men had as much emotional responsibility  as women, showed feelings, loved and nurtured children.</p>
    <p>All programs had a curriculum.&nbsp; They educated while they entertained and they  encouraged children to engage in activities other than television, particularly  reading.&nbsp; Characters were models who encouraged children to try things for themselves,  participate without needing to win.&nbsp; We  presented our country to Australian children and showed them that their own  lives were worthy of close examination and that they could help shape the  future.</p>
    <p>The third component of Government cultural policy for  children's television, along with regulation and the establishment of a  Foundation, was the setting up of the Australian Film Finance Corporation, a  film bank which subsidized the production of Australian content: feature films,  documentaries and television series.&nbsp;  Under this subsidy umbrella, children's production was to be given special  treatment.&nbsp; As it turned out the  financial deals achieved by the producers of children's television often  exceeded those achieved for adult programs.&nbsp;  The returns to the Film Finance Corporation from the sale of children's  programming outside Australia  were far better than anticipated.</p>
    <p>The Australian story of children's television demonstrated  that regulation alone is not the answer. Regulations need continual monitoring  to ensure objectives are met as circumstances change, which they invariably do.  The second lesson learnt is that quality will not be met by a free market.  Producers must be educated regarding children's needs but also need to be&nbsp; highly creative.  Children's production is not the place for would-be or failed producers,  writers and directors. It is not an inferior production genre to be used as a  stepping stone to Hollywood,  although some see it that way.</p>
    <p>Thirdly there must be recognition that the best children's  programs will not necessarily pay their way. Just as we need to subsidise  schools, we need to subsidize the programs that will support the development  and enlightenment of children. They are the future but it is the present that  counts. We need to give children the best chance in life we can.</p>
    <p>All the best for your plans for children's programming in Colombia.</p>
