    <p><strong>&nbsp;Dr. </strong><strong>Patricia Edgar</strong><strong></strong></p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>As today's keynote speaker, I stand before you in place of a  very famous man - Nelson Mandela. So I have much to live up to.<br />
        I have been asked to speak about values.</p>
    <p>How we form values is a very complex philosophical issue.  Our local Melbourne paper carries  regularly what they call an 'Odd Spot', where they report on strange incidents  around the world. Recently, this one caught my  eye. </p>
    <p><em>Fifteen armed robbers  raided a monastery in </em><em>Brazil</em><em>, stole about $8000, then made a priest swear on a Bible that there was  no more money on the premises. They asked forgiveness before leaving.</em></p>
    <p>What a mix of values there! They stole, they recognized  their sin, and they did not hesitate to make use of the Priest's vulnerability  for their own ends.</p>
    <p>I am not speaking today of such expedient values, but of a  cohesive philosophy for an utopian society, a visionary system which gives all  its citizens a place and a purpose. How do we strive for such a society? And  how do the media impact on the formation of such values for children?</p>
    <p>The media model that dominates the world is Western,  and predominantly American. </p>
    <p>The values represented by the dominant Western  media and most of the programs made, are largely irrelevant to the needs of  most children in the world today. </p>
    <p>The reasons are obvious. The President of the World Bank,  James Wolfensohn, spoke recently about the fundamental cause  of conflict, terror and disequilibrium in the world, as poverty.(1)</p>
    <p>Five out of six people live in the developing world yet we  are spending $1,000 billion a year on military expenditure and only $50 billion  on development. We are spending $300 billion in agricultural subsidies, while  people starve. Our world has half its people, out of 6 billion, living on less  than $2 a day, and about 1.2 billion living on less than $1 a day.</p>
    <p>Half the world's population is under 24 years of age. A  quarter - 1.5 billion - is under 14 years of age.</p>
    <p>An ideal global society must deal with this imbalance. And  nation states must also deal with this imbalance within their own borders.</p>
    <p>If young people are to grow up to be constructive rather  than destructive, they have to have hope and opportunity. They must be offered  something to live for, to believe in, to value. And Western  media with its pressure to buy, buy, and buy, its violence and sensationalism,  cannot claim to do that.</p>
    <p>We now know the importance of a child's early years. If  children are not given the stimulation and support they need in those early  years, they will grow up to become marginalized adults. Their health,  nutrition, literacy, numeracy, social and physical skills, are all important.  But just as crucial is the development of their emotional and moral  intelligences for their social well-being. Children require healthy bodies,  educated minds, and social values. The importance of early development IS as a  predictor of everything that follows. And for children to develop a sense of  social purpose, that is crucial for their well-being, they need to understand  who they are, they need to know their cultural roots through hearing and seeing  their own stories.</p>
    <p>They need to belong --to a family, a community, a country, a  culture and then, and only then, they can know their own identity and their  place within a global community.</p>
    <p>Belonging verifies a set of values and beliefs. The give and  take of living in a family and a community must be learned at an early age.  Such learning comes from example&mdash;nothing will surpass lessons from  experience&mdash;but also from story-telling. And this is where we come in.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;The Western  media model will not and cannot answer this need for most children today. There  is a crisis of meaning in the West. Decent core values are hard to find within  our institutions. So we cannot buy the bulk of our&nbsp; the programs in, from outside, that we need  for our children. We have to make our own. This is true for all producers who  aspire to do our best for the young and who are driven by ideals rather than  commercial success.</p>
    <p>In making our own programs what can we learn from what has  already been created?</p>
    <p>First Western media content is violent and second, it is  market driven. But the impact or meaning of these characteristics is not  necessarily obvious.</p>
    <p>The single question that has most pre-occupied researchers  in relation to children and the media is, 'What is the impact of media violence  on children?&rdquo; The lobbyists have used as their main justification for the  production of programs for children the desire to protect them from the  violence depicted elsewhere. </p>
    <p>Yet despite the multi-millions of dollars expended on  research on the subject of media violence, the findings are spurious.</p>
    <p>Two large studies in the early 1960s, one in the US  by Wilbur Schramm and his colleagues, and one by Hilde Himmelweit in the UK,  concluded:</p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;For <u>some</u> children, under <u>some</u> conditions, <u>some</u> television is harmful. For <u>other</u> children under the <u>same</u> conditions, or for the <u>same</u> children under <u>other</u> conditions, it may be beneficial. For <u>most</u> children, under <u>most</u> conditions, <u>most</u> television is probably neither particularly harmful nor  particularly beneficial.&rdquo;(2)</em></p>
    <p>Effects studies continued in the US  and became a self-perpetuating industry for three decades. Clear answers were  not found, because the wrong questions were  being asked. Researchers focused narrowly on the trivial, counting acts of  violence, and missing the bigger issues. </p>
    <p>Some British researchers, notably David Buckingham, (3) in  the UK&nbsp; pointed out that effects studies were missing  the social and narrative context. Researchers&nbsp;  judged cartoons as excessively violent, when children understood the  animation genre and the conventions of other genres. Children were not passive  observers of violence and a researcher cannot assume the experience is negative  simply by analyzing the content. </p>
    <p>The context of the violence is what makes it acceptable or  unacceptable, and the depiction of violence in drama is essential for children  to understand the world in which they are growing up. </p>
    <p>The answers are not clear. Yet the belief that media  violence is harmful does not go away. </p>
    <p>The factors that have been identified as risk factors for  children who are in trouble - are child abuse, family breakdown, unemployment  and poverty, isolation, lack of social success, peer group pressure. The media  are not high on the list of influences when other risk factors are absent. But  trying to isolate the impact of media alone misses the bigger issue.</p>
    <p>While media violence may not be a major factor in explaining  individual acts of violence, it may however, be a very important factor at the  societal level. The media depict&nbsp; a very  violent world, and the media exploit that violence in news programs as well as  in sport and fictional drama. In the society we see on television there are  high levels of aggression, and there is wide acceptance of anti-social  behaviour. There is a heightened sense of threat and insecurity. As a result of  viewing this type of&nbsp; programming, day  after day, people (viewers) perceive the world to be a much more dangerous  place than it actually is and fear they will be the victims of violence. This  is particularly true for the vulnerable - those living alone, women and older  people. As well, perpetrators learn that aggressive attitudes and behaviors are  often acceptable. </p>
    <p>Media content has changed its form in the past few decades.  Morality tales are now rare. Remember when the hero drew his gun only when he  was provoked, and always in the service of good? (4). Increasingly the models  of behaviour in films, television, video games and music are anti-social.  Gangsters, drug dealers and psychopaths are often glamorized.</p>
    <p>Right and wrong are no longer clear concepts. This extends  way beyond fictional programming. Witness the war in Iraq  and the debate that surrounds it. We don't believe our politicians any more.  And the examination of their manipulation of facts becomes part of the media  environment. Altogether this media world presents an experience where the  values depicted are at best ambiguous and confusing. And our young see this.</p>
    <p>Further evidence of the impact of the environment on social  context for criminal behaviour comes from the epidemic theory of crime which  Malcolm Gladwell describes in his book <em><u>The  Tipping Point</u></em>. (5 ) He says that crime is contagious. It can start with  a broken window and spread to an entire community. The tipping point is not a  person, but something physical, like graffiti. In the 1980s, New    York City was regarded as one of the most violent  cities in the US.  In the early 90s crime declined significantly, and declined more than in any  other city in the US.  Muggers and robbers were not operating as they had been. Why?</p>
    <p>The New York  subway was covered in graffiti and regarded as highly unsafe in the 1980s. A  new subway director was appointed, who decided to clean up the system, line by  line and train by train. The graffiti clean-up took 6 years. Next, they cracked  down on fare beating - cheating the system. Plain clothes police manned the  turnstiles and would nab fare beaters and handcuff them into a daisy chain, and  leave them standing there to signal the crackdown to everyone else. Anyone  arrested for fare beating who was carrying a weapon came in for other charges.  Soon the travelers started leaving their weapons at home.</p>
    <p>Police stepped up the enforcement of laws against public  drunkenness and public urination, and arrested those involved in minor damage  on the street, like throwing empty bottles.</p>
    <p>Minor, seemingly insignificant, quality-of-life crimes, were  tipping points for violent crimes. By tinkering with the smallest details of  the subway, the epidemic of violence related to traveling in New    York was reversed.</p>
    <p>What this theory suggests is that the urban criminal - far  from being someone who acts for fundamental, intrinsic reasons and who lives in  his own world - is actually someone who is alert to all kinds of cues, and who  is prompted to commit crimes based on his perception of the world around him.</p>
    <p>Behaviour, it is argued, is a function of social context.  And no issue is too small to have an effect. Cleaning up the street can have  more important consequences than one might think. If we apply such thinking to  the media environment, we can see we have a long way to go. We need to clean up  our programming, the way we present news, sport, lifestyle and fiction  programmes and the advertising that blends them all together, if we aspire to  changing social values and to living in civilized communities.</p>
    <p>Many in the West are questioning the individualism,  materialism and consumerism that dominate our way of life and the media which  play an integral role in selling and endorsing these values. </p>
    <p>Some researchers have argued that, as with the violence  debate, concerns about consumerism and advertising to children are  conservative, paternalistic and neglect the diverse and complex ways in which  children use and relate to cultural commodities. (6)</p>
    <p>Again, I believe such views miss the bigger issues. </p>
    <p>Marshall McLuhan (7) got it right when he said, 35 years  ago,<em> &ldquo;The medium is the message.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>In essence, he argued that society is  shaped more by the nature of the media by which men communicate than by the  content of the communication.</p>
    <p>Just as the machine altered the nature of work, the car  extended cities, created suburbs, changed our lifestyle, altered breeding  patterns, introduced shopping malls, advertising hoardings, and drive-in  theatres. The history of the car is a history of unintended consequences. (8)</p>
    <p>So too is the history of media. Television transformed the  home, and life within it. An alliance between the consumer and the manufacturer  began, through advertising direct into every home. Innovations in selling  through buying on credit, packaging entertainment and advertising, all played a  part in turning every home into a unit of consumption. Consumer culture  re-defined youth, transforming it from a time of growth, and transition to work  and family responsibilities, to a time of membership in a distinct consumption  community. (9).</p>
    <p>Children as young as two are now consumers, dictating to  parents their demands, and merchandising aimed at children is worth billions of  dollars. The figure for sales of Barbie Dolls alone - the top-selling toy brand  in the world - is reported at US$3.6 billion in 2003 (10).</p>
    <p>Consumerism has led to a quest for meaning through  possessions, and to people working more than they want, doing jobs they don't  like. The market focuses on individual wants, at the expense of public  services, environmental protection and community centres. ( 11) </p>
    <p>It is argued that consumer culture has given meaning and  satisfaction to contemporary affluent society in diverse ways, and has been  part of a unique formula for economic growth. But the down side is becoming  more and more apparent.</p>
    <p>The environmental impact alone of a global consumer American  standard is a frightening prospect. As China  craves its hamburgers, the jungles, the lungs of the earth, are being destroyed  for beef grazing land. </p>
    <p>Any society that subordinates every value to the market,  divides those who can buy from those who cannot, undermining social cohesion.  Inequality is increasing in the wealthy countries and around the globe.</p>
    <p>As well, there is evidence that many Americans and certainly  Australians and other Westerners, are  realizing that consumption and the emphasis on individualism which undermines  community, is creating a greater sense of unhappiness and alienation. People  are asking why, when we have never been so well off, are we not fulfilled?</p>
    <p>Abundance, too much of a good thing, comes at a cost. If we  look, as an example, at the food industry, one of the biggest advertisers of  products to children on television, this point is beyond dispute. In the US,  excess fat claims 300,000 lives each year. The Atlantic Monthly recently  reported that the number of overweight people on the planet - more than 1  billion - exceeds the number of malnourished. More than half of all adult  Americans are overweight, and a quarter are obese.</p>
    <p>And how did this happen?&nbsp;  12</p>
    <p>It began in the 1970s. Nixon's government liberated the  farmers from government regulation. Farmers ploughed from fencerow to fencerow.  By the mid-70s, corn production soared to an all-time high. So did farm income.</p>
    <p>Food scientists in 1971 found a way to produce a cheap  sweetener from corn syrup. It was six times sweeter than sugar, and it kept the  product fresh-tasting, giving it a longer shelf life. Products looked more  natural. At the same time, palm oil, a highly saturated fat, became a  substitute for other fats, for the same reasons. It was cheaper, it lasted  forever on the supermarket shelves.</p>
    <p>Having brought the price down, and the calories up, the  marketing guys got to work and&nbsp;  discovered that people generally would not buy two servings of French  fries or two burgers, but they would buy the super size, the value-added meal.  Super-sizing led to a revolution in eating. By 1996, 25 per cent of the $97  billion spent on fast food came from larger-size portions. A serving of  McDonald's French fries ballooned from 200 calories in 1960 to the present 610  calories. What was once a 590 calorie McDonald's meal was now 1550 calories. By  1999 heavy users - people who eat fast food more than 20 times a month -  accounted for $66 billion of the $110 billion spent on fast food. (13)</p>
    <p>The shift of women into the workforce meant that by 1994  American families ate 34% of their food away from home.</p>
    <p>Add to that the fact that physical education programs were  cut from school curricula because of cost, and  the school canteens (which had responsibility for providing balanced meals)  were being outsourced to fast food franchises. </p>
    <p>The fast food outlets targeted poorer areas where the  families are larger, and then targeted &ldquo;tweens&rdquo; or pre-teens. They began a  youth advertising campaign. New ad agencies were formed simply to handle the  Saturday morning slot and target kids specifically. Advertisements for food  were more than one-third of the ads. placed in the Saturday slot.</p>
    <p>So we saw campaigns like the Happy Meal formula, McDonalds'  parties for kids, Pizza Hut changing its long-time jingle &ldquo;Pizza Hut and  nothing more&rdquo;.&nbsp; To &ldquo;More Rock 'n' Roll,  more fun&rdquo;. Free toys and cartoon characters were used to market Burger King,  Mars, Cadbury, Nestle, Coca Cola, Pepsi - and they all went giant size.</p>
    <p>Now in 2004, about 25 per cent of Americans under 19 years  are overweight or obese. That number has doubled in 20 years. These young  people will battle illness for most of their lives - Type 2 diabetes, bone  disease, respiratory and cardio-vascular diseases. </p>
    <p>Advertising to children does not appear so benign in this  context.<br />
        Advertising has carried the message that it is a comfortable  world, eating is fun;&nbsp; it's healthy to be  fat; bigger is better.</p>
    <p>Slowly we have woken up and fast food advertising to  children is on the agenda. The medical profession in America  and in Australia  is sounding the alarm; not the U.S. FFC - the Federal Communication Commission,  or the FTC - the Federal Trade Commission. Those two regulatory agencies say  nothing and do nothing.<br />
        The same is true in Australia.</p>
    <p>Yet when Janet Jackson bared her right breast on television,  for a few seconds at the NFL Super Bowl early this year, the FFC in the U.S.  began an immediate investigation into the incident, because  of the people's outrage. Then, of course, the press printed the picture and  television repeated the incident as 'news' many times over. Such is our media  environment.</p>
    <p>It's a bit like the Odd Spot about the robbers and the  priest I mentioned earlier. Double standards permeate our culture.</p>
    <p>But McDonald's is finally getting the message. In Australia,  in what the fast food giant claims as a world first, labels detailing the fat,  sugar, salt and energy content of standard items such as the Big Mac will be  introduced across the Australian menu before the end of the year. And the chain  will eliminate super-size French fries and soft drinks from its American menus  by the end of the year. (14)&nbsp; The  super-size soft drink in the US  is 1.2 litres.</p>
    <p>The issues that need to be considered are not: Do children  and young people understand the difference between advertising and programming?  Or, Are advertisements assisting them to become more educated consumers? Or,  Are children more vulnerable to advertising than adults?</p>
    <p>We need to step back, as McLuhan did, and ask ourselves the  big questions.</p>
    <p>Is the media model coming out of the US,  and being emulated around the world, desirable or appropriate - not only for  your children, but for society as a whole?<br />
        &nbsp;I don't believe so.</p>
    <p>Is the Western model of  consumerism sustainable for us all in the long term? Clearly it is not.</p>
    <p>Can 6 per cent of the world's population effectively impose  its will, its values - its media power and technological superiority - on the  other 94% of mankind?<br />
        &nbsp;Not for long.</p>
    <p>So what are the values we should be attempting to convey to  our young people?</p>
    <p>During my childhood, where I grew up in an isolated rural  community, the outside world did not impinge much at all. I grew up in a close  network of family and community relationships that defined my world - my  values, my beliefs and my identity. I knew little about what lay outside that  world. Today, we are all irrevocably involved with and responsible for one  another, and television and technological advances in communication have  brought this about. At the same time the networks of family and community have  broken down. We have to work on all fronts if we are to reverse the social  breakdown.</p>
    <p>In Brazil,  you are engaged in a great social experiment. What happens in Brazil  could be a model for the developing world. Roughly the size of the USA,  you have been a colonized and violent nation, and one of the most unequal  societies on earth. After two decades of economic stagnation and corruption,  you have elected a leader in President Lula who plans to redistribute wealth  and power and get the regional economy growing again.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Brazil,  he says, &ldquo;wants to find its own way.&rdquo; (15) He will have to fight powerful  interests to achieve his vision for Brazil.  But his life and his tenacity is a model for Brazilian and Latin Americans, and  for us all. </p>
    <p>It may well be that we will never create a perfect social  order, and that some of the problems of our age may be insoluble.</p>
    <p>But most of us are here because we want to try and make a  difference. And so we have to work on changing the world as we know it today.</p>
    <p>As the anthropologist Margaret  Mead once said, &ldquo;A small group of thoughtful, concerned citizens can change the  world. Indeed that is the only thing that ever has.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Young people must be taught what matters in life. Without  values, they have no meaning or purpose in their lives, no sense of belonging,  no sense of hope.</p>
    <p>We are social beings. The pursuit of individual choice and  personal satisfaction over the collective good will ultimately bring about our  undoing. And television can be a wonderful medium to inspire and inform. I have  spoken about the excesses but there are many here today who have created  wonderful examples of the kind of programming that fits with desirable social  goals. This Summit is all about  making a difference, changing directions, or making a start.</p>
    <p>In March, 1995, Nelson Mandela, then President of South  Africa, sent a message to the First World Summit in Melbourne.  In part, he said:</p>
    <p><em>The future of our  planet lies in children's hands. All of you involved in television, which is  one of the most powerful influences on children, have an awesome responsibility  on your shoulders.</em></p>
    <p><em>At a time when it  appears that the moral and the cultural fabric of our society&hellip; is disintegrating,  it is ever more important that we instill in our youth and children a strong  sense of values, a compassion and understanding of one another's culture and  humanity, and offer them knowledge about the world.</em></p>
    <p><em>In this light, we must  broadcast to our children across the nations the best the world has to offer  and not consider them merely as a consumer market. The opening up of airwaves  and the erosion of borders must not be seen merely as an opportunity for the  developed world to reach new markets. It should create new vistas for two-way  communication between producers and viewers. The vast majority of the world's  children are found in developing countries, and their voices and stories must  be heard too.</em></p>
    <p><em>Exposure to differing  world views and experiences can only lead to greater understanding and harmony  among nations. If our children are nurtured in this kind of environment, then  we will have paved the way for them to build a more peaceful, and prosperous  world, rather than one torn asunder by greed and lust for power.&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p>Nelson Mandela said in 1995, concisely and eloquently, what  remains a most important message today.</p>
