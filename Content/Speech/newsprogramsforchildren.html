<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p><strong>OETI</strong><strong> -has been working for some time exploring  the value of news and current affairs programs for children and young people  for their development, education and entertainment. It is investigating  programs produced around the world as models of ethical television to inform  young people. I endorse the conclusions reached at the first meeting held in </strong><strong>Madrid</strong><strong> in April 2005 but see many pitfalls and  obstacles to the production of such enlightened news programs for children</strong></p>
<p><strong>My perspective is as  an Australian whose career has spanned positions in teaching at Secondary  School and Tertiary levels; as a media, communication researcher whose PhD  studied the Impact of Self Esteem on Children's perceptions of Media Violence;  as a policy developer on many Government Committees; as the Founding director  of the Australian Children's Television Foundation and Founder of the World  Summit Movement on Media for Children.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;I have lived through a decline in the ethical  standards on television for children despite decades of advocacy on their  behalf. Commercial television is the major culprit however public television is  emulating all the characteristics of a market driven television culture.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;A Reflection On News</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>I think we would all agree that to  live and survive on our challenging planet young people must have hope and  belief in the future. To believe in the future they must understand the  problems they face and learn how to solve them. Mankind is a problem-solving  species and our responsibility as adults is to help our young acquire the  knowledge and the skills they will need to solve successfully the problems they  will face. They will be new problems that we cannot possibly understand,  therefore we need to instill in our youth a thirst for knowledge, an  understanding of the process of inquiry - an education about how to learn as  well as what to learn. </p>
<p>We live with conflicting  interpretations of the state of the world today. There are those who argue life  has never been better: we have reduced poverty, created more wealth and  increased life expectancy more in the last 50 years than we did in the previous  5000 years. But many others say that things are getting worse: poverty and  inequality are on the increase; the environment is being destroyed and nature  is responding, creating turmoil through disasters; wars and terrorism are  dividing people.&nbsp; Regardless of which  interpretation of history and politics we prefer, the way forward is the same.  We face significant challenges. We may be very good at solving problems but  there is no shortage of problems to be solved. The future depends on our  ability and the ability of our children to do so. </p>
<p><strong>The question is, can News Programs for Youth help this process?</strong></p>
<p>I think News Programs as we know  them in Australia,  are part of the problem, not part of the solution. The media news transmit  continuously, local stories of disaster and predictions of global economic,  environmental and social catastrophe. The media are voracious consumers of our  time and we spend many hours in our week viewing a never-ending saga of life's  difficulties. We know from research such exposure has an eroding effect on our  confidence, creating fear, feelings of hopelessness and inertia. Those who view  the most hours of television have the most pessimistic view of the world,  believing they live in an environment which is even more threatening than it is  and there is little they can do about it.</p>
<p>In Australia  in the 70's there was a song which was very popular with young people with the  words:<br />
    &ldquo;I'm watching a horror movie right there on my TV &hellip; <br />
    It's a horror movie, it's the 6.30  news.</p>
<p>The planes are smashin'<br />
    The cars are crashin'<br />
    The cops are bashin' - oh yeah<br />
    The kids are fightin'<br />
    The fires are lightin'<br />
    And dogs are bitin'- oh yeah</p>
<p>The public's waitin'<br />
    For the killin' and the hatin'<br />
    So they switch on the station - oh yeah<br />
    They do a lot of sellin'<br />
    Between the firin' and the yellin'<br />
    And you believe what they're tellin' - oh yeah&rdquo; </p>
<p>Thirty years after those words were  sung I have a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. News Programs today are more graphic, more  immediate, more sensational but convey no more accurate a view of the world we  live in - despite the amazing technology at the disposal of journalists.</p>
<p>Recently I asked my 11-and 8  year-old grandsons what they thought of the news. Their response was immediate: <br />
    &ldquo;I don't understand why so many people are fighting. <br />
    &nbsp;They make it like  everything's bad; dead people and fighting: nothing good; broken legs at the  football.<br />
    Zombie news reporters: when something bad happens they don't  look upset. They are weird. In the ads they smile, but on the news they are  serious, like robots who can't feel emotions.<br />
    &nbsp;I'd like to know  what's good. I enjoy knowing what's happening&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Teaching understanding the News, by explaining the construction of the  very programs that are meant to inform us, is for me our first task with young  people.</strong></p>
<p>The news is defined in the  Macquarie dictionary as <em>'a report of any  recent event, situation, etc; the report of events published in a newspaper,  journal, radio, television or any other medium;&nbsp;  information, events etc considered as suitable for reporting;  information not previously known.'</em>&nbsp;  So according to the dictionary definition, news is simply what any news  organisation decides is news and this is confirmed by the research studies  undertaken in Australia. </p>
<p>Thirty years ago I edited a book of  research studies based on the way journalists work and the nature of news  organizations: <em>The News in Focus: the  journalism of exception</em>. Still today, the prevalent school of journalism  throughout the world, is the journalism of exception - a journalist does not  report, &ldquo;Everything is fine today in Pakistan&rdquo;,  she reports the unusual, the sensational, the conflict and violence. News does  not tell us all the planes landed safely today, news tells us one plane  crashed. News does not tell us we eradicated polio and malaria, it tells us  bird flu might kill millions of people. It is important we know these things  because knowing about them alerts us to the need to solve the problems  disasters present, but as a program intended to inform, educate and develop our  children into ethical adults News Programs have significant limitations.</p>
<p>All television stations in Australia  begin their evening programs with a news service which has a prime purpose of  attracting an audience which will stay with the station for the evening's  viewing.&nbsp; In both commercial and public  television the success of a news service is judged by the number of viewers it  attracts; the higher the ratings the more profitable a television station can  become. The more profitable the station, the fewer risks its management is  prepared to take which might jeopardize a station's leadership in the ratings.  News can titillate, exploit, and provoke but it can't afford to offend and lose  viewers, so we have a system of warnings, news readers give&nbsp; - which often mean people viewing sit up and  take more notice, particularly children unsupervised. Commercial television  news - which most people watch - has become a victim of the medium's success:  its form is dictated by the drama programs that make up the evening's schedule.  And more and more, public television seeks to emulate that ratings success.</p>
<p>Newscasters have become media  stars; they try to appeal to their audience demographic, and in Australia,  news anchormen are well clad, smart and trim and women news readers commonly  look like emaciated Barbie Dolls. Public relations firms took over the  packaging of news, in the early Seventies, persuading station management that  news anchors, weathermen and reporters should exude personal magnetism and  showmanship.&nbsp; Instead of simply imparting  information to the viewers, they set out to attract them: viewers did not want  serious newscasts, they argued, they wanted personalities, comfort and  assurance, cheap thrills and amusement - in a single word,  'entertainment'.&nbsp; </p>
<p>There are some very able reporters  who work in television journalism who vehemently defend their professionalism,  yet the news is subject to constraints, beyond their control. Budget, time,  immediacy - the nature of the medium itself and the ideology of the society in  which we view -&nbsp; all impact on news  values and the decisions made by news editors because News is a business: the organization  decides what&nbsp; news will attract viewers  and beat the competition in the ratings game. So what the viewer sees on  television is a highly structured, manufactured product, very selective and  firmly supportive of the status quo.&nbsp;  News is a form of knowledge which has more to do with social control and  social cohesion than offering information, encouraging diversity and  impartiality. </p>
<p>The need for objectivity and  balance are concepts touted often, in discussions about news, and Australia's  two public TV Networks - SBS and ABC - try to achieve them more rigorously than  the commercial channels. In the process they are often attacked for bias,  especially when they become critical of the government in power which controls  their budgets, so they become more cautious. The more we need to know the less  we are told. News reports must have pictures and content reduced to a punchy  segment. The in-built bias of commercial stations goes unchallenged. Trainee  journalists are from their first day on the job socialized and subjected to  intense pressure to seek peer-group approval; they are sent out with older,  experienced journalists to watch the way to approach a story and to copy that  approach.&nbsp; Their path to success lies in  understanding the priorities that determine what will be published or broadcast.&nbsp; Those who learn those priorities and conform,  achieve success by 'getting a run'.&nbsp;  Those who do not 'get a run', fail as journalists. The system shapes  them: they do not shape the system. News then is what newsmen decide, and what  the news organisation they work for sees as news.&nbsp; </p>
<p>An important story for a News  organization is not what those of us seeking ethical new programs may see as a  priority.&nbsp; A&nbsp; BRUNETTE STABBED TO DEATH. can achieve more  prominence in the news than, 6000 Killed in Iranian Earthquake. ONE US SOLDIER  KILLED IN BOMB ATTACK assumes far more importance than: 100 Iraqis dead in an  explosion.</p>
<p>In  recent times, news coverage on Australian television has extended to 'embedded'  promotions, where the line between the program, the advertisements and program  promotions ceases to exist.&nbsp; The  integration of commercial message promotion, news and entertainment is  intrusive: the voice for the advertisement is the voice of the actor in the  soon-to-be-screened drama: the sports commentator makes scripted wise-cracks  about an advertisement just screened for a coming attraction as he segues back  into sports commentary; the banter between news-casters promotes an  up-and-coming, not-to-be-missed, current affairs program. As the lines dividing  information, advertising and entertainment are increasingly blurred, most of  the audience does not complain. News has become entertainment because that is  what people seem to want. And there-in lies the major problem in creating  effective and ethical news programs for young people: they are just like their  parents; they want to be entertained.</p>
<p>And with children there are  additional issues. Most children don't like the news and don't want to watch it  at all.&nbsp; Research indicates children  believe the news, and they believe films which are simulated to look like  news.&nbsp; Most children do not understand  how events can be contrived.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we want  children to understand events, they need to view them from their point of  view.&nbsp; Children identify with things that  relate to their own experience and those things will differ for each child, and  certainly for different cultures. The child in Iraq  will have a different view from a child growing up in Melbourne,   Australia - or in Brazil,  Japan or South    Africa. In Australia  we have a broad mix of children from different cultures so there are different  views to accommodate. Our Prime Minister has recently suggested we should be  teaching an Australian narrative view of history (whatever that might mean) to  unite different perspectives.</p>
<p>In the face of these complex  issues, in some circles I now hear it said, quite seriously, that we adults  have made such a mess of programs for children that it is now time to step back  and allow children to show us what should be done and created with today's  media.&nbsp; Certainly there are children who  are a jump ahead of their teachers in understanding technology; they learn  quickly how to use it and how to create with it. This does not mean, however,  that we adults should abdicate our responsibilities in a free-for-all led by  children.&nbsp; They should clearly be  partners in an enterprise to inform them, but surely we have learnt something  from the programming experiences of the last half-century, with which to create  a legacy from our learning.</p>
<p>OUR TOY NEWS IS NOT THE MODEL TO  INFORM YOUTH<br />
    I think we should teach children that much of the television programming they  view is trash. We should ask ourselves and answer the question: what are the  effects on individuals and society of allowing economic criteria and ratings  success to determine news and information programs in a democracy? Young people  need to understand that the toy news we have created with its toy presenters,  who play with the audience, is a construction; it is a manipulation of events,  designed by a broadcasting industry driven by profit and the need to secure its  audience over and above any need to correctly inform that audience fully about  world events and differing perspectives on those events.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We need to rethink the programs we  make for our children and the form they should take if young people are to  learn as well as be entertained. The ideal news program(s) for them should  contain the following elements:<br />
    - deconstruction of news programs,<br />
    - documentaries on relevant issues  from a child's viewpoint,<br />
    - drama,<br />
    - comedy;(the program must be  engaging for children and they enjoy drama and comedy most of all)<br />
    Progress in producing such programs  will only be made if this is a joint enterprise between educators, young people  and program producers.</p>
<p>The best idea I can think of that  includes all these elements is:<br />
    &nbsp;A television program supported by an  interactive website which is linked to the program - a teen comedy-drama -  based around the lives of a bunch of students who come together to produce a  weekly youth television current affairs program. The program within the program  involves current affairs including sport, music, art, films. Along the way the  actors/ characters live their lives as they deconstruct and construct a regular  news program for their peers. Those watching can take an active part  constructing segments, and stories for the show, provide feedback and ideas.  Teams of young, investigative journalists could develop in schools and  communities and interact with the show.</p>
<p>Well scripted, such an idea could  contain all the elements we seek for a News Program aimed at the development,  education and entertainment of children and young people.</p>
