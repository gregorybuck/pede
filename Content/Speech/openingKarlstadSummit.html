Address to the Sixth World Summit on Media for Children and Youth </span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Karlstad,
Sweden, June 14<sup>th</sup> 2010&nbsp; </span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>&nbsp;The Summit
movement began 15 years ago in Melbourne Australia in 1995.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Our aim was
to protect and promote quality children's television programs. Technologically
we have travelled light years beyond our first objectives. As well
globalization has led to a focus on the international marketplace rather than
national child audiences. These issues present significant challenges for the
Karlstad Summit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>&nbsp;Only one
year after the first Summit in 1996, Google emerged. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE><i><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:
EN-US'>Facebook</span></i></span><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:
EN-US'> launched in February 2004 and <i>YouTube</i> in 2005.<i> Twitter, </i>born
in 2006, is the SMS of the internet. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Today more
video is up-loaded to <i>YouTube </i>in 60 days than all three US television
networks have created in 60 years. People are adding photos to <span
class=SpellE><i>Facebook</i></span> at a rate of nearly 1 billion unique images
a week. For young people, the games industry is as important as television.
&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>&nbsp;Kids have
embraced new technology – its interactivity, social networking and mobility. As
a result they are no longer the audience we thought we understood. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>&nbsp;Research
shows young people in the developed economies spend an average of 10-12 hours a
day interacting with media. But they are a fragmented audience, more
unpredictable and more difficult to reach than they once were.&nbsp; So despite
the huge global marketplace, children's media production is more competitive
than it was 15 years ago. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>&nbsp;Kids are motivated
to play, listen, create, chat, watch and respond to a constant stream of
messages about everything they encounter in life. They enter the adult world
before they are teens and their tastes and interests are often confronting.
They view television less, when they want and how they want so the conventional
television audience we used to expect is shrinking. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>&nbsp;Children's
embrace of media is not just a western phenomenon. Kids everywhere, given
access, have the same love of technology. One startling example can be seen in
the work of Professor <span class=SpellE>Sugata</span> <span class=SpellE>Mitra</span>.
He found - with his Hole in the Wall experiments in a remote Indian village,
where he put a computer in a wall and left it - within hours an 8 year old was
teaching a 6 year old to browse, and 300 kids learnt all the uses of the
computer in 3 months.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Young
people's immersion in media is a gift to the children's entertainment industry,
but the content we are producing lacks the excitement new technology generates
– it remains predictable, heavily commercialized and often irrelevant to the
needs of 21<sup>st</sup> century children.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>You can't
tell a public broadcaster from its commercial counterpart anymore. There is
sameness in their programs and an obsession with ratings. The two major forces
that have dominated children's production since television began are struggling
to find their way and missing a great opportunity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Media are
now a potent educational force in children's lives. Kids are spending more time
with media than in school and media are certainly teaching values to the next
generation more effectively than schools. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>But
entertainment producers have been slow to respond to the educational challenge
while they can exploit media's commercial strength. Likewise teachers are
ignoring the opportunities new media present, while they argue for smaller and
smaller classes - a teaching model which is unsustainable. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>A new 21<sup>st</sup>
Century global vision for children's media and education policy is needed. For
the Summit to be effective in leading the policy, research and production
debate, we must ask some fundamental questions. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>What is the
responsibility of producers to the education of children?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Is good
programming incompatible with making profit? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>How do we maintain
quality and meet the challenges of new technology? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>How do we
best develop an integrated cross-platform approach to children's production?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>What links
are there between media and creativity and how can they be used for learning?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>I believe
this is a great time for content creators. There is challenge and opportunity
like never before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>I believe
we must insist education and entertainment be integrated within new media
policy. Separating these goals has allowed the media industries to escape responsibility
for children's development and education bureaucracies to ignore the potential
for learning media present. Curricula on media literacy, while an important
part of the mix, are not enough. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Innovation
in education and in production is fundamental to progress, to economic
stability and global peace. Media's role is central. The relationship between
children and media has changed <span class=SpellE>for ever</span>. Surely our
responsibility is greater than contributing to their amusement. This Summit
provides an opportunity to explore these issues.</span></p>
