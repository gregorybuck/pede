Etherington'</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:
"Arial","sans-serif"'>Held in Mildura 28-8-2011</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:
"Arial","sans-serif"'>Dr. Patricia Edgar :</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>For
more than three-quarters of a century Reg Etherington was actively engaged in
this city, Mildura,  as a business-man, City Councilor, as Mayor, Chairman of
the Council Finance Committee (for many years) and as Chair of a host of other
cultural, local government and community initiatives. Though his contribution
was much wider than to his home town, he left such a mark on Mildura's
development that he came to be known by friends and colleagues as Mr Mildura,
or Mr Fix-it and, by others, Mr Right.  He was also my father and today Don and
I aim to give you some insight into the nature of the man and to talk about
some of the work he did in the community that is not so well known.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Reg
was born in Faversham, Kent UK on 28th of January 1905. His father was a
carpenter and joiner; he was working-class British. His parents decided to
migrate to Australia in 1912 when Reg was 7. He was the fourth child in a
family of six children. One more child would be born in Australia. They settled
in Thornbury a northern suburb of Melbourne where Reg attended Wales Street
State Primary School and then University High School in Melbourne on
scholarship. He learnt to play the clarinet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>When
he left school he decided to become apprenticed as a watchmaker and jeweler. He
was working in Melbourne when he heard about an opportunity. Mr Horace
Hammerton in Mildura was seeking an apprentice and was offering 5 pounds a week
and a promise of a share of the profits. Reg applied and got the job. It was
December 1, 1924; he was 19 years old. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>While
working for Mr. Hammerton, Reg studied optometry by correspondence part-time,
obtaining the degree of Fellow of the Victorian Optical Association. He was
number 21 on the register and the first qualified resident optometrist in
Mildura.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Four
years after his arrival in Mildura, and after surviving typhoid fever, Reg
decided he would settle here. He had his eye on a young woman (Eva May Ellis)
he had met singing in the Methodist Church Choir. She worked at White's shoe
store. They decided to marry and Reg wanted some security for the future he
planned with Eva, so he asked Mr. Hammerton for a formal agreement,
acknowledging what had been promised to him when he came to Mildura. But
Hammerton wasn't prepared to give him a written agreement. 'Don't be silly
Reg', he said. So Reg gave a week's notice and set up in business against his
employer. 'I'll see you go broke', was Hammerton's  response.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>It
was 1929 and Reg was aged 24 years. It was an audacious move but typical of
him. He took risks, he worked hard, and he had a strong will; when challenged
he would be determined to succeed. He did not lack in confidence. While others
waited for him to go broke, Reg prospered. His focus moved from watch-making to
the optical business but at the same time he bought into Wilson's jeweler's
business. In 1932 he brought his older brother Jim from Melbourne to run the jewelry
business which remains in Deakin Avenue today. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>In
the late thirties Reg bought a fruit block in Karadoc Avenue and built up an
orange orchard and poultry farm. He brought his younger brother Alec up from
Melbourne to run the block.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Reg
had a way with people. He was gregarious, he had a great laugh; he loved a good
yarn. Although the thirties were very tough years to be creating a business,
Reg earnt a loyal following. His working class roots gave him an understanding
and easy connection with men who labored with their hands and minds, as men in
such a pioneering agricultural settlement as Mildura did. The women also liked
him. He would joke and he was kind. He was generous to his clients; they paid
when they could afford it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Mildura
at that time was a failing, salinated, dust bowl, a small town on the Murray
River with few facilities. There were no paved roads or foot-paths, no sewage
system, or sporting facilities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>He
married Eva on 7 October 1931. They moved into 13 Sarnia Avenue, the home they
would live in together for 67 years. They paid 500 pounds for the house and put
down a deposit of 50 pounds. They had 10 pounds over in their kitty and Eva's
housekeeping budget was 2 pounds a week. Mum loved flowers and Reg created a
garden for her at 13 Sarnia Avenue and entered a novice gardening competition
soon after moving in. On the day of the judging he dug up the flowers from the
backyard and replanted them in the front garden to make a good display. He won
the competition and was very proud of the silver cup.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>He
planted a small Norfolk pine tree in the front garden which grew to a great
height, well beyond the roof, lifting the pavement so it was difficult to move
along the footpath at the side of the house. He would not trim it and the tree
remained until after his death in 2000 when the house was sold. I think it was
the tallest tree in the city of Mildura. It was a landmark and arriving in
Mildura we always knew where our house was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Reg
and Eva had three daughters and I was the youngest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>I
was a big disappointment in my father's life as, like all men of his
generation, he desperately wanted a son to carry on the family name and to have
a father/son relationship - take the boy shooting and fishing, show him the
ropes, continue the family business. As the third daughter and final try, Reg
had to reconcile to his daughters and his lack of a male heir, which he did
admirably. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>He
was a very good father; strict but caring. We did not go to bed at night
without a story, usually one he made up and although he seemed to be out every
night of the week he was there at mealtimes and to put us to bed.  He taught us
to swim, ride horses, encouraged us to play musical instruments and we went
regularly to the seaside at Glenelg for holidays. When the polio epidemic came
Dad remained in Mildura but Mum and we kids went to live in Glenelg. Family was
very important to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>We
lived in one room - the dining room next to the kitchen. (The lounge room was
for visitors in those days). It had a fire in winter and was the only warm room
in the house. The radio was there so after tea in the evening the family
gathered there. Dad had a comfortable armchair and we sat around the table on
rather uncomfortable dining chairs he had made. (He made all the furniture).
Mum invariably knitted. We played cards, board games, listened to the radio and
did our homework.  Reg had the phone beside his chair and it seemed he was
always on the phone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>I
grew up in a household where politics were as familiar to me as the values of
the Methodist Church where I went to Sunday School. It seemed nothing of any
importance happened in Mildura that my father was not involved in, and there
was no dirty business. He was straight and direct; he always had a clear vision
of what he was on about and he gained support for his ventures by the sheer
force of argument. I heard much of what went on over the phone without even
knowing I was listening. I observed as men came to the house with their
problems to seek my Dad's advice. Mildura was a community where everyone knew
everyone. Growing up, it seemed everyone knew Reg Etherington.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>My
father retired from optometry in 1952 ( aged 47) so he could devote more time
to public service and for more than the next 40 years that is what he did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>While
Reg was committed to public service Eva was the same. Apart from her work as a
housewife which she did exceptionally well (she was a great cook and washed and
ironed clothes like they came out of a professional laundry) her interests were
the Red Cross, the CWA, the Deaf Auxiliary, and the Church. She paid for and
did the flowers in The Methodist Church every Saturday for 20 years from
1946-66. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>I
now realize my father and my family was unusual but when I was growing up in
Mildura I took our life for granted. The tasks Reg took on weren't easy. Change
is not a simple process. His causes often made him enemies rather than friends
but he loved a challenge and the satisfaction he gained was in the tangible
benefit he saw resulting from his political efforts. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Mildura
bears his mark in its electricity system, its sealed roads and curbs, its Arts
Centre and Art Gallery (which he got funded without initial cost to Council),
the old Mildura Homestead, its Historical Society, the legacy of the Mildura
Sculpturescape, the many charities he raised funding for.  In later years when
reflecting on life he once said to me, "I'm an initiator, that's my nature. So
much was needed in Mildura. There is little in this town that was worthwhile,
that I wasn't involved in.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>In
October 1999 <i>The Sunraysia Daily</i>  published a special issue to celebrate
<i>A Century of Sunraysia 1900 - 1999</i>. In that publication there was a
profile on Reg Etherington entitled <i>Etherington vision was a treasure to
behold.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>'...<i>His
contribution to this community is immeasurable. He has served on Mildura City
Council for 18 years including being Mayor from 1954 to 1956. During his time
he was for seven years the Chairman of the Finance Committee and in this
capacity he revolutionised techniques, making the process more efficient and
more effective. Roads were greatly improved, all road sealing being taken right
up to the gutters. Through him, the Mildura Electricity Supply was sold to the
SEC to the greatest benefit of the community. </i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:
"Arial","sans-serif"'>Without him we should not have had the Mildura Arts
Centre. He went out on a limb making the building of the Arts Centre one of the
key points in his platform, prepared to take the consequences and voters, to
their eternal shame, voted against him. Now all agree that he was right and his
vision is our treasure. </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:
"Arial","sans-serif"'>He was the government nominee on the building committee
of the Victorian Arts Centre during the time of its planning and construction.
Through him the Victorian Regional Galleries Group was established. He served
for many years as President of the North-West Victorian Ballet Guild and saw
that organisation make great progress. </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:

and District Historical Society, and became the foundation President, a
position he was to hold for 29 years. Through him, the reconstruction of the
Mildura Homestead became possible; he had a genius for knowing which were the
best sources of funding. He was to chair the Homestead Committee for many
years. </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:
"Arial","sans-serif"'>He served as a member of the Mildura Methodist Church
Trust and was the key figure in getting the Wesley Church building a heritage
listing. He served as President of the Mildura High School Advisory Council
from 1961 to 1976, having been on that Council from 1951. One of the many
projects he saw carried through was the building of the school's gymnasium. </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:

long association with Rotary, having served as president of Mildura Rotary and
was District Governor in 1949. He was Worshipful Master of Mildura Lodge in
1943 and was chosen to be a foundation Master when Lodge Sunraysia was formed. </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>In
his early years Reg love to read Shakespeare and Dickens who were among his
favourite authors. He would mark in pencil in the front of the books, pages
with particular quotes that took his interest, and he would often craft
speeches around the ideas he took from literature which illustrated his own
thinking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>He
could quote from memory long speeches from a number of Shakespeare's plays. A
speech I would hear quite often throughout my upbringing was from <i>Hamlet.</i>
The character Polonius is giving advice to his son Laertes. The speech ends
with the words. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:
"Arial","sans-serif"'> Thou canst not then be false to any man”. </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>My
father lived by that value.  He believed a strong community grows out of
conflict at times, not just agreed and shared values. It's necessary to argue
and negotiate in a civil manner. He was never afraid to stand up for his
beliefs and argue the case. He was good at it and so to some he was an
intimidating man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>I
know there are many people in the community here with a record of contribution
to community like my father. Yesterday Don Carrazza called on the community to
support the leaders in the community. The future and strength of the community
lies with you as individuals who are concerned about the future of rural
Australia. I was born and bred in rural Australia and while the problems today
are more to do with maintaining development, of adapting and managing change,
the process is no different. We are all building our community.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>The
anthropologist Margaret Mead once said that a small group of thoughtful
concerned citizens can change the world. Indeed it is the only thing that ever
has. Reg, my father, was one of those people. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>In
August 2000 I was called in Melbourne to be told by my sister that dad was
failing fast. I was surprised because he had no terminal disease. I came to see
him with my daughter and took him in a wheel chair to the park. We bought some
fish and chips and sat on his balcony. He was sucking on a chip and I asked him
what he was thinking about. He replied "I'm thinking about the good time I
would be having if I was having a good time”. It was a comment that was typical
of him. He asked to be helped onto the bed and he never got up again. He just
decided he had had enough. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>He
died Sept 2000 at the age of 95 after a long and productive life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:
"Arial","sans-serif"'>Reg Etherington Lecture :           Dr Don Edgar</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>As
you can see from Reg Etherington's long list of civic activities, he was a busy
man. As Chair of the Council's Finance Committee for many years, he played a
vital part in ensuring that Mildura emerged from being a dusty little town into
a thriving small city, with paved roads, streets with proper gutters and
drainage, good town services and excellent schools. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>His
attitude to civic life is summed up in his saying, "<i>Public life is an
interesting thing. People get in there supposedly for the community, but when
they get there, they enjoy the personal kudos; they forget the rest of it and
become despots. They're not interested in the next generation, they're only
interested in the next balance sheet. ... Their philosophy is hate. There's no
need for it. I get into arguments, I get heated, but you don't need to get
abusive.”</i> Looking back, in his later life Reg commented, "<i>This paying of
aldermen is wrong. Voluntary community service. All most of them have ever done
is complain about what's wrong with something that's already there. However!”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Reg
was a cultured man, well educated, well read, with a keen interest in
literature and ideas. He was, above all, a thinker. And one aspect of life he
felt was missing – though he played clarinet in the orchestra and there was an
active life of theatre in Mildura, was the arts. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:
"Arial","sans-serif"'>The arts in Mildura and beyond</span></i></b><b><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'> :</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>When
R.D Elliott offered his art collection to the city of Mildura in 1944, the
Mayor (C.D. 'Cammie' Cameron) jumped at the chance, but there was the problem
of where and how to house it. (Elliott owned the Sunraysia Daily and radio
station, several other regional newspapers, had been elected a Senator for a
short while and was an implacable enemy of Keith Murdoch, Chairman of Trustees
at the National Gallery in Melbourne. As a fellow Trustee, Elliott opposed
anything Murdoch supported, including the purchase of Australian Impressionist
and more modern paintings and the plans to separate the old museum and art
gallery and build a new arts centre at the Wirth's Circus site on St Kilda Rd.
But he had actively collected art during and after his time in London as
adviser to Lord Beaverbrook, Minister for the Airforce and War Supplies. And he
supported involving ordinary people in the life of the gallery.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Reg
Etherington knew Elliott through his Mildura business life, his close
connections with the Lanyon family and his work as Chair of the Minor
Industries War Agriculture Committee. So when Elliott died in London in 1950,
the city moved quickly to ensure that his widow Hilda Elliott fulfilled
Elliott's promise. The Chaffey Homestead was up for sale so Reg and Town Clerk
Bill Downie devised a scheme to raise money to buy it for the city. They sold
the city's electricity plant to the SEC, ensuring an ongoing supply and
garnering the Elliott collection for Mildura. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>The
1950's have been called 'The Cactus Years' in terms of the arts, but when you
dig deeper, they proved to be astonishingly rich.  The cultural cringe was at
last challenged by Australian artists, the Menzies government built on post-war
prosperity and new Premier Henry Bolte asserted Victoria's right to a place in
the sun, with a new State vision, pushing large civil works, encouraging new
business and, ironically for such a conservative man, giving much support to
the arts. The 1953 Herald Outdoor Art Show gave the public a taste for modern
art, the Melbourne art scene bubbled with controversy, and Eric Westbrook was
appointed Director of the NGV. Bolte passed the National Gallery &amp; Cultural
Centre Bill to make a start on the new Arts Centre. He also supported
Melbourne's hosting of the Olympic Games in 1956, an event which stimulated
pride and forward-thinking across the whole community.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Reg
Etherington (who had close connections with the Victorian Liberal Party) was
appointed to the Arts Centre Building Committee. He wanted a share of the new
arts funding for Mildura as well and he met with the leading figures to discuss
forming a new group.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>As
part of this trend, the old regional galleries of Bendigo, Ballarat and Geelong
wanted their share. The group first met at Geelong Art Gallery and Reg, with
Geelong art teacher Don Webb, successfully lobbied for funds from the State
Government to support each of the regional galleries. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>What
is not widely known is that, apart from his long years of support for the arts
in Mildura, Reg Etherington was singularly responsible for supporting the
development of other regional galleries and, subsequently, theatres and
combined arts centres. When Hamilton was offered the Sandby watercolor
collection, local chemist Dempsey (like Reg) was vilified by others for
supposedly running the city into debt. Reg urged him to hold firm and it was
Dempsey's casting vote as Mayor that secured the future of Hamilton's regional
art gallery. He was closely involved in getting Swan Hill going, first with a
small gallery on 'The Gem' and then later with the Pioneer Settlement. His
friend Laurie Ledger, a Benalla agriculturalist and businessman, had been
collecting Australian art for many years and didn't know what to do with it.
Reg was horrified to see many of the paintings hanging on the walls of Ledger's
shearing shed. He suggested offering the lot to Benalla City Council. Ledger
made the offer, only to be rejected by Council on grounds of costs, nowhere to
house the collection and the old theme of 'what do we need art for?' Ledger was
infuriated, but Reg talked him into paying a huge lump sum to build a new
gallery and convinced the Bolte Government to provide matching funds. The
Council finally weighed in behind the project and Benalla has its fine regional
gallery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>As
the Melbourne Arts Centre progressed, Reg insisted it have a lounge for country
visitors and began to argue for regional theatre as well as art gallery
funding. His battle to build the new Mildura Arts Centre (opened in1966) is
legend, with local opponents such as Kay Gambetta and Dr Blair maligning him on
grounds of costs to the ratepayers. In fact, the whole project cost the city
nothing until it was completed. Supporters such as Neil Noyce and Henry Tankard
tell the story of Gambetta and others carrying round a tape recorder during
Noyce's conducted tours of the building project to see if they could pick up
anything incriminating while they and others like Maud Nettleton scraped their
feet on the concrete floor to spoil the recording. Tom McCullough describes the
whole process as harrowing but in the end rewarding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Reg
played a key role too, in the development of the Geelong Performing Arts
Centre, working closely with the Geelong Committee, lobbying effectively,
bringing in the Melbourne School of Architecture to work up designs. He
claimed, in a letter to Rupert Hamer in 1969, broadening the case for country
interest in the Melbourne Arts Centre : <i>'there would develop in country
municipalities an interest to build theatres which would require State Government
financial assistance. </i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:
"Arial","sans-serif"'>Responsible people with a knowledge of art galleries
overseas express the view that nowhere in the world is there in evidence a
complex of galleries with the potential for servicing the complete area of a
State than exists in the State of Victoria.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:
"Arial","sans-serif"'>I am of the opinion that a similar situation is possible
of achievement in the field of the Performing Arts. It is fortunate that at
this time there has been formed in Victoria a branch of the Arts Council of
Australia, whose field of activity lies almost entirely in provincial areas. It
is commendable that the State Government has seen fit to recognize this
practically by way of a financial annual grant.'</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Etherington
was flagging a more coordinated approach to all the arts across Victoria, one
which was later rejected by some as galleries asserted their own particular
focus against that of drama and music. Indeed it was courageous commentary on
his part, because the Regional Galleries Association was negotiating at the
time for an increased grant for its member galleries.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Reg
was also key to Mildura's possibly most famous contribution to the arts in
Australia – the Mildura Sculpturescapes. Started by Ernst Van Hattam in 1961,
this grew to become <u>the</u> sculpture event in Australia, with McCullough in
the late 60s and 70s encouraging new forms of sculpture, experiential works,
causing a lot of controversy in Mildura. Reg described one fellow 'sitting on a
swing, naked, swinging from the stage of the arts centre, pissing on the
audience!' Probably apocryphal, yet typifying the bafflement of many local
citizens. But that legacy remains both at the arts centre and through the
streets of Mildura.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Running
parallel with all this activity in the arts, Reg Etherington had other, more
scientific interests. The impetus for this derived from the British
Government's alarm at the V2 rocket attacks on London and its realization after
American atom bombs fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki that nuclear warheads could
be attached to the new missiles. Winston Churchill had bombed the German rocket
manufacturing base at Peenemunde in Holland, dispersing the V2 enterprise and,
on VE Day (8 May 1945) there was a race by the US, Russia and Britain to grab
the rocket scientists and obtain the new technology. Britain missed out, so
decided to start its own work on missiles. In 1946 the Evetts Report
recommended setting up the Salisbury Weapons Research Establishment and
developing a vast rocket range at Woomera in South Australia. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>As
one of Victoria's first qualified optometrists, and because of his connections
with RD Elliott and his work with the Minor Industries War Agricultural
Committee, Reg Etherington was asked by the Department of Post-War
Reconstruction to tour optical factories in Britain and the USA. He was at the
time (1949) District Governor for Rotary International, covering the whole of
Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>The
Cold War climate and the Korean War of 1950 led Prime Minister Chifley to insist
Australia be part of British scientific rocket research (Britain resisted) and
by 1951 Salisbury had started work on the pilotless Jindivik airplane. Rocket
testing at Woomera was in full swing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>On
his return  in 1949, Reg was contracted by the Department of Supply to make
optical lenses for a range of military uses: telescopic and rifle sights, and
then Askania theodolytes which were used to track missiles fired from the
Woomera Rocket Range. He recruited skilled lens grinder Stan Johnson from
Melbourne, was supplied with equipment to use in the small Mildura workshop and
set up Etherington Optical in a Nissan hut behind <i>The Dragon Tower</i>
Chinese restaurant in Langtree Avenue which he owned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>In
1954, an Australian named Frank Dixon at WRE invented the world's first
wide-angle lens, the 'fish-eye' lens. It was unique because it could take a 360
degree photo, thus enabling rockets to see over the horizon. As such it marked
the beginning of the new age of inter-continental ballistic missiles, an age
that led to the fear of nuclear attack and Reagan's 'Star Wars' exercise aimed
at stopping any future attack from space on the United States. It was this
wide-angle lens that made Etherington Optical a top secret production facility.
To make full use of the rocket range and this wide-angle lens, scientists
invented the new WRECISS and WRETAR cameras, one attached to the nose of a
target Jindivik, the other to the missile being launched against it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>And
the wide-angle lenses were made in Mildura. In addition, Etherington Optical
manufactured prisms, optical blanks, rifle telescopic sights, submarine and
tank periscope lenses, binocular and range-finder lenses. Reg had applied to
the Minister 'Black Jack' McEwan in 1954 for a glass import licence and foresaw
the potential for a world-class optical manufacturing industry for Australia.
By 1959, they were in full production, but it was a frustrating experience for
Stan Johnson and Reg Etherington. Bureaucratic bungles led to equipment
delivery delays, supply of faulty Chance glass slabs, inefficient grinding
machines, incorrect specification for some lenses, and unnecessary rejection of
'faulty work'.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>By
1958-9, Britain was secretly testing guided nuclear missiles ('Blue Steel' and
'Blue Water'), but because they were being left behind by Russia and the USA
(its sky-to-air "Skybolt' missile) and because there was unease in Britain and
NATO at escalation of the arms race Britain withdrew.  So, suddenly, English
Electric had to abandon its nuclear missile project, sacked 1000 workers and
closed its Luton factory. This left Etherington Optical high and dry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Never
easily daunted, Reg wrote to the Department of Supply in 1961 urging that his
industry was a vital one for Australia and that imported optical instruments
not be allowed in preference to the Australian product. The Australian
bureaucratic and political establishment seemed unable to appreciate the future
potential and lost its opportunity to keep Australia at the forefront of
optical and missile research and manufacturing. Reg closed down his secret
Mildura plant and Stan Johnson left for Salisbury.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Australia's
loss in optics was its gain in other areas such as the arts, because Reg
Etherington continued his work, consolidated the funding viability of the
Regional Galleries Association and led the rebuilding of the Old Mildura
Homestead (1984). As he often said, '<i>Money is only a lubricant, that's all
it is.</i>' He was a remarkable man.</span></p>
