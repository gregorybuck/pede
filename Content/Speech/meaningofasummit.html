    <p>WHAT IS THE MEANING OF A SUMMIT TAKING PLACE IN LATIN  AMERICA FOR THE FIRST TIME? </p>
    <p>Interview with Patricia Edgar for Multi  Rio, Rio de Janeiro, November  2002 <br />
    A Summit is an  opportunity to draw a line in the sand and mark a new beginning. It provides an  opportunity to rally all those with strong interests in children's media to work  together to create a climate and opportunities to ensure the production of  programs for children that are engaging but meaningful for them. Holding this Summit in Latin   America signals to your Governments that you are very serious about this  issue; that you are ready and willing to work together across regions and  nation States. It also signals to the dominant Western Producers that you are  not simply a compliant marketplace for imported programs but that you intend to  produce for your own children and ultimately take your place in the  international marketplace and produce a share of global product. A Summit gives  significant impetus to your cause, it raises  the profile of the issue in the media, and  increases the level of determination necessary to achieve the objectives of the  Summit Movement. <br />
    &nbsp;  One of these objectives is to increase the critical awareness of children  towards the media and as you plan to have a large number of teachers  participating in the Summit, their  involvement with&nbsp; the issues would hopefully lead to changes in the  curriculum to further this aim. The Summit will  highlight for teachers and producers just&nbsp; what they need to work towards  if productions for children in Latin America are to be  improved.</p>

    WHAT  KIND OF BENEFITS DO YOU THINK THE RIO SUMMIT 2004  WILL BRING?&nbsp; DOES LATIN AMERICA HAVE ENOUGH  STRENGTH TO LEAD IMPORTANT CHANGES?</p>
    <p>The  Rio Summit will set the stage for the future. It will create an environment where  it will be possible to advance the cause of children's media. In the end it  comes down to the leaders of the movement and the participants believing they  can accomplish whatever is necessary. I have no doubt you already have people  in place with the will and the know how to do this. <br />
    Latin America is home to a huge population and  that population is young. In the West the population is aging, the figures are  staggeringly different. That is the basis of the power of your argument for  resources and support from Government from business and from the media  organisations in Latin America. Your young  people should not be served with media programs from foreign cultures alone.  Buying cultural or media products is not the same as buying shoes or fruit or  cars. Cultural products impact on the mind and they reflect the values of the  culture that creates them. Latin America certainly  has the strength to lead the changes. That means you have the individuals with  the will to work for what they believe in, the artists to tell the stories  children want and need to hear, and the politicians who will respond-- who will  recognise the importance of the self esteem of their young people who need to  participate in their own futures. <br />
    A  major difficulty that you will face is the argument about priorities. Why worry  about media programs for young people when health and housing needs, education  and welfare generally are so much more pressing? They are pressing, and they  are fundamental, however education in the end is the only way to move forward  and to overcome serious social inequalities and issues. And today media are an  integral part of that education process. Indeed when formal education is  lacking, the all pervasive media are even more influential in instilling  values. It is to ensure the values and images conveyed through media programs,  which can be so potent with young people, are values that are congruent with  the social and cultural objectives of the society in which they live that  children's and young peoples' programs cannot be neglected. Every culture must  tell it's own stories to its children or the culture dies, and it will die if  it is to rely on the stories of other cultures to initiate its young people  into our global world.<br />
    What  does it matter if all the children's stories were to originate in Los Angeles? We would  lose our diversity our complexity our richness as human beings. More  importantly the life style and the behaviour of the inhabitants of Los Angeles are not  relevant to those of most of your Latin American children. </p>
    <p>WHAT  ARE THE MAIN DIFFICULTIES YOU HAVE FOUND IN CHANGING THE MENTALITY OF  POLITICIANS ABOUT ISSUES YOU CONSIDER ESSENTIAL?</p>
    <p>In  the 20 years I spent as Director of the Australian Children's Television  Foundation I reported to more than 80 State and Federal Arts Ministers who were  responsible for the funding of the Foundation and their reactions varied from  an extreme of open hostility and a belief that it was a waste of money  (fortunately there were not many of them )to great enthusiasm for the work of  the Foundation. Generally speaking it was the younger Ministers with children  of their own who were the most supportive. I always made a point of researching  the ages of their children and sending tapes of our programs when ages were  appropriate for the programs. There is strong lobbying potential in the support  from&nbsp; family members who are the consumers of our productions. Politicians  are very busy people with many demands on their time, and viewing children's  programs will not be high on their list of priorities . You need to have the  ear of others who are close to them. Politicians wives are important and they  will have children or grand children. It is important to work with people from  all sides of the political spectrum so that the issues the Summit addresses  are not seen as the concerns of a single party.&nbsp; On the Board of the ACTF  I ensured that there were influential people who could open doors,  representatives from all sides of politics, men and women who could not be  ignored by senior politicians. Every politician will have people they will  listen to so you need to do your homework and track them down. Lobbying is  central to this task. </p>
    <p>MOST  PEOPLE CAN SAY WHAT'S BAD ABOUT TELEVISION, BUT RARELY CAN IDENTIFY QUALITY.  HOW WOULD YOU IDENTIFY QUALITY ON TELEVISION FOR CHILDREN? </p>
    <p>Technically  the media are neutral whether it be radio, television  or computers we are dealing with. Each is a wonderful medium and can  convey powerful, creative, enriching programs which have the potential to  develop and educate young people. Unfortunately the predominant financing model  for programming around the world is commercial and the media are used to  sell products and fuel the economies of countries, even more so with global media markets.  This objective is seen as far more important than developing quality programs.  Programming for children and young people is now very much driven by merchandising. Even a  broadcaster with the traditions of the  BBC is no longer immune, and programs like <em>Teletubbies</em> and the <em>Tweenies</em> have been developed  to fit the money making model. The tail wags the dog and the audience is  exploited for commercial ends. The prime purpose is not simply to teach and  enrich the audience but  also, and often primarily, to make money. The approach is justified by the  argument that the means justify the end, the program gets made and children  have something to watch that is made for them, even though at the same time the  program is serving as an advertisement. <br />
    Quality  can be elusive. It&nbsp;certainly does not necessarily correlate with money  spent. For a program to be a quality program I would say the idea for the  program must have integrity. It should come from the needs of the children. As  you say very eloquently in your questions to me, understanding the inner  world of children is an important step in creating TV programs that can reach  and touch them deeply.&nbsp; Programs should engage them but they should never  suspect they have an educational purpose, so they should not be overtly didactic. Young  viewers should be stimulated to reflect from the experience of viewing a  quality program.&nbsp; A good story is crucial, children love drama but it  needs to be authentic. They  want to identify with the characters and to learn about life experiences. They  do not like to be patronised and preached to. Good programming will reflect  life as they know it. Program makers debate the issue of quality but the good  producers know it when the see it. Often the debate is about what it is that we  should show children and what we should hold back. Sometimes this is a cultural  question. This topic is certainly an important one for discussion at  the Summit. </p>
    <p>YOU  DEDICATED A WHOLE LIFE TO BRING SIGNIFICANT IDEAS TO REALITY FOR THIS AUDIENCE  AT THE AUSTRALIAN CHILDREN'S TELEVISION FOUNDATION. CAN YOU DESCRIBE A  REMARKABLE EXPERIENCE AT ACTF?</p>
    <p>Nothing  beats watching children view a program that I have been responsible for, and  actually observing the body language and the impact when they are very involved  and enjoying what they are seeing on the screen. That's pretty remarkable. That  is worth fighting for. <br />
    And  it is always a remarkable experience for me to see an idea evolve from a simple  concept to a full blown program and to see the layers that are added by each  creative person as they make their contribution to the whole program. Film and  television are truly collaborative arts and I found that with many of the  talented people in Australia who worked  for the Foundation they took pride in what they did because they were working  for children and for a cause. <br />
    Next  to that, winning the Emmy for an Australian children's drama, only the second  Australian Emmy ever won by an Australian production team, was significant for  the status of the Foundation and the industry. It helped me to move the agenda forward  and to raise more money for the cause. Politicians in particular like to see  tangible results and awards are one measure of results. </p>
    <p>WHAT  WOULD YOU SAY TO MEDIA PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN PRODUCING GOOD TV  PROGRAMS FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH? WHAT CHALLENGES ARE THEY GOING TO FACE? </p>
    <p>The challenges  are many. Remaining determined in the face of indifference is essential.  Hearing the word 'no', but persisting until you hear the word 'yes', is  important. You have to be a lobbyist as well as a program maker. You need to be  able to remember what it was like to be a child. Even though the world has  changed significantly, children and young people still go on the same emotional  journey on the road to adulthood. You need to understand their world if you are  to be relevant and successful. If you don't love the work, don't do it. There  are easier ways to make a living. </p>
