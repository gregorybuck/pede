        <p><strong>Address to the 5th World </strong><strong>Summit</strong><strong> on Media  for Children</strong><br />
            <strong>Johannesburg</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>South Africa</strong><strong>, March 2007</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Patricia   Edgar</strong><strong> President,  World </strong><strong>Summit</strong><strong> on Media for Children Foundation</strong></p>
        <p>The first world summit on television for children was held  12 years ago in Melbourne Australia.&nbsp; Two months before&nbsp; that gathering I shared one of the  greatest experiences of my life - the birth of my first grandchild Adrian.&nbsp; I now have four grandchildren and they are my  vivid barometer of the dramatic technical and social changes of the past 12  years. I love these children as we all love our children and want to see a  world where they have a future and they may develop to their best potential.</p>
        <p>When I travel to or read about the developing world I am  overcome by the immensity of the problems children face and a sense of guilt  that my life and my children's lives have been so advantaged. Yet our lives,  whatever the path are interlocked- there is no clearer demonstration of that  fact than climate change. This is a debate which when first raised was  ridiculed, then met with vehement opposition, now 90 per cent certainty, very  soon self evident.&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe an  analogous debate is that of children and media.</p>
        <p>I decided to hold a World Summit in 1995 because, as one who  had devoted my life to media reform for children, I was alarmed by the changes  I could see coming, but I had no idea just how serious these changes would  be.&nbsp; </p>
        <p><strong>Les</strong><strong>sons from the West</strong></p>
        <p>When I began my work children's  programming was a service to children.</p>
        <p>-The 90's saw the arrival of global American children's  channels - Disney, Nickelodeon, the Cartoon Network and Fox Kids - with their  brands, their franchises and associated merchandising.&nbsp; These channels demonstrated the revenue  raising potential of licensing with publishing, music, videos, games, along  with any children's products that could carry a logo.</p>
        <p>They were part of a complete change of view about the  profits to be made from the children's market.</p>
        <p>- Budgets for advertising to children in the US,  the flagship of the Western world, have risen from $100 million to $300 billion  during my grandson's short life. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;-Over the same period  obesity has become the single biggest threat to child health in the Western  world with juvenile diabetes at record levels. </p>
        <p>While many of your children are underfed, we are feeding  ourselves to death. The overweight people on the planet- more than 1billion-  now exceed the number of malnourished. </p>
        <p>-Lifestyle magazines for 'Tweens - 8-12 year olds - a  product of the last decade, sell fashion and sex and the desire to look and  behave like adults. Such marketing&nbsp; is called Corporate&nbsp; pedaphelia in Australia.</p>
        <p>- Television magazines, fashion and fast food companies  combine with phenomenally successful marketing campaigns which tie together  toys, clothing and junk food to sell a lifestyle to children.</p>
        <p>-We promote a dysfunctional mismatch between biological  maturation and social maturation which is leading to mental and physical health  problems for young children.</p>
        <p>In my grandson's lifetime we have moved from a broadcasting  structure where children had no choice but to consume the media they were  given, on radio, film or television - to one where children not only access the  media of their choice but play a large role in creating it for them selves. The  first World Summit was about television. Today the technology includes mobile  phones, MP3 players etc</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>More and more children are going  online to access whatever they want.</p>
        <p>And nowhere is the partnership between food, fashion and  media for kids more apparent and well integrated than when you go online.&nbsp; Creative forms of marketing draw attention to  brands in a playful way. Advertising and entertainment are blurred. Sex is part  of the deal.</p>
        <p>Sophistry bedevils the debate.&nbsp; The food and beverage industries insist we  should exercise more; the media industries insist it is not their problem they  only offer entertainment.&nbsp; Government  calls on parents to be the guardians of their children: they can turn off the  sets, say no, refuse to buy, feed their children  healthy food.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>But business conspires against parents.&nbsp; Marketers are way ahead of the game as they  bring the best minds to bear on ways to access and develop this lucrative child  market.&nbsp; The advertising industry insists  it is not responsible while it pushes the boundaries with skilled campaigns-  using sex increasingly to sell to the young.</p>
        <p>As we debate the pros and cons of regulation and parental  responsibility, exercise, fast food, children's fashion and sexuality, and  advertising's linking- role in all things, we are losing the battle for quality  children's programs.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>The television industry worldwide has forsaken its  responsibility to children's development as marketing to them drives the  agenda.&nbsp; So children watch programs of  inconsequence which consume their time, when their sharp acquisitive brains  should be stretched and stimulated. And I don't hear the Save Children's TV  advocates raising their voices against advertising, consumerism, or the poor  quality of their own programs.</p>
        <p>Brands are ubiquitous and the fight to resist is  overwhelming for parents. We have squandered television's capability to teach,  inform and inspire; we are systematically destroying children's bodies along  with their minds.&nbsp; The life affirming  stories that could help them develop into socially integrated human beings have  gone.</p>
        <p>This agenda has been driven by 6% of the world's population  who are attempting to impose their will, their values, their media power and  technological power on the other 94% of the human kind.</p>
        <p>We are at the second stage of my analogy. Some of us have  survived the ridicule and now meet violent opposition. </p>
        <p>The West must curb its excess, quickly. Sustainable  development can't occur without drawing on the lessons learned.</p>
        <p>All our children will have to deal with imbalance in the  global world and the one resource they will have to do this is their brain  power.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>The developing world can make the argument that you are not  going to repeat the mistakes of the West. But our global systems are so integrated&nbsp; and our  survival is so clearly interlinked that we must work together.</p>
        <p>We need to recognize firstly the economic model of infinite  growth is unsustainable for all of us so to teach our children to consume from  toddlers through the media is a nihilistic approach.</p>
        <p>The problem for those of us with a concern for children, is  that we are up against colossal market forces, promoting products that are  seductive to the young which falsely promise a lifestyle which can never be  delivered -&nbsp; but  which for young people is compelling.</p>
        <p>One response is I hear said is adults have stuffed things  up, so let the young people decide.&nbsp;  Young people are very smart and know much more than we often appreciate  and in Africa you recognize this by the inclusion of  young people in your programs.&nbsp; They are  your population.&nbsp; But, without guidance,  education, nutrition and support they stand no chance. We have to take  responsibility and work to mine the energy, the vitality, the ambition of youth  and temper it with the knowledge that comes from life experience.</p>
        <p>We need policies for children to integrate their health,  education and social development with media.&nbsp;  Most child policy and programs fail to pay attention to the all  pervasive influence of the media; most government advisers and early childhood  experts don't even mention television, advertising and the Internet.&nbsp; Nor do they see the positive potential of  good quality early childhood programs with drama, music and information, to  enrich the lives of children and develop the brain power every child will need  if they are to survive and thrive in the information age.</p>
        <p>Media for children must have an educational goal, not goals  to sell soft toys or designer clothes.<br />
            Media must be trustworthy and put the interests of the child  as citizens of above the interests of profit. <br />
            Children must be treated as active participants in the  production and consumption of media content. <br />
            The schools are major players in&nbsp; media programs for children who will  always need guidance.<br />
            Effective children's media must just take risks, push the  boundaries, explore new possibilities, raise new questions, challenge children  to think and act effectively. </p>
        <p>The issue for the world media summit movement is no longer  simply one of media production for children, important as that continues to be. <br />
            Storytelling is the key to understand human behaviour,  traditions, history, transmitting important cultural values and learning how to  solve problems. Our task is broader, an ethical agenda to challenge the pursuit  of consumerism and personal gratification over the collective good.&nbsp; Media offer wonderful opportunities to  educate to inspire and bring us all together.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This international forum has spawned a number of meetings  around the world and will continue to do so. The Summit  movement is a catalyst to inspire reform of the media industries to act in the  broader interests of children. The provision of children's programs must be an  obligation on broadcasters and media distribution systems, and the exploitation  of children as the market should cease.&nbsp;  It is now self evident that if children spend their early years in a  compromised environment they are at risk.&nbsp;  For those who can only grasp the economic argument and ignore the moral  issues they should understand: for every dollar invested there will be a  gain.&nbsp; Educated, engaged children mean a  future for this planet. fewer teenage pregnancies,  higher school achievement, fewer dropouts and a better employment record.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>We are perilously close to a tipping point from which there  may be no return.&nbsp; Action now and  investment in prevention will pay us back many times.&nbsp; <br />
            In a report released this year by UNICEF that measured child  well-being 'The true measure of a nation's standing is how well it attends to  its children - their health and safety, their material security, their  education and socialisation, and their sense of being loved, valued and  included it in the families and societies into which they are born' on a  measure of six dimensions the Netherlands came out on top with Sweden second.  That is an important basis on which to build for Summit 2010.</p>
