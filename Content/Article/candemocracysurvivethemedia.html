<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";

</span><span style='font-size:7.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>Lindsay Tanner's newly published book&nbsp;<i>Sideshow</i>&nbsp;claims
that over the past two decades the media nationally and internationally have
been dumbing-down democracy through shoddy journalism which emphasizes
entertainment over serious discussion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>Tanner's argument is not new. Media scholars have long known that
media technology has changed the nature of politics. Radio almost destroyed the
Monarchy before George VI found his voice and as Marshall McLuhan astutely
observed back in 1964 with television,&nbsp;<i>The Medium is the Message.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>The miniaturisation and diversity of technology have resulted in a
highly lucrative competitive, commercialized genre which dictates form over
content. It is not surprising news values have been debased in the process and
that politicians talking policy are not a priority for the news bulletins. The
news culture Tanner describes is inherent in the beast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>The more interesting material in&nbsp;<i>Sideshow</i>&nbsp;is
where Tanner describes the behavior of politicians and political parties in
response to the evolution of news as entertainment. Tanner firmly believes
politicians are victims simply responding to the conditions set by debased
political journalism. As the media are a critical component of our democracy a
politician has no choice; either they go along with the sideshow or they become
irrelevant to the electorate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>Tanner claims the November 2010 election campaign was the worst
ever with a deeply cynical public voting for 'none of the above'.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>In his acceptance speech at the recent television Logies veteran
political journalist Laurie Oakes, who has been working for decades in the
Canberra Press Gallery, likened his addiction to journalism to that of a crack
cocaine addict. Oakes was the journalist who reported two major leaks during
the election which derailed Labor's campaign and turned off voters. Leaks
generally result in stories about conflict and deception making for headlines.
They are an example of the 'gotcha' journalism Tanner describes<i>&nbsp;</i>and
that in Oakes' words 'gets the adrenaline flowing '. Tanner canvasses the idea
in his concluding chapter that the Press Gallery should be moved out of
Parliament House to sever the incestuous link between politicians and
journalists.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>Tanner's assumption in&nbsp;<i>Sideshow</i>&nbsp;that if the media
performed its job more professionally and effectively the standard of politics
would improve, is wishful thinking. John Howard learnt how to reach the masses
and it was not with erudite content. Tanner agrees, the masses are not
interested in politics and no amount of subsidized quality content will entice
them. Education is not a solution as the better educated abandon mass media for
specialized media. Direct government regulation would be counter-productive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>Tanner acknowledges the importance of the ABC for the democratic
framework and sees some hope in talk-back and community radio, but he sees them
as limited because they reach an 'elite'; those already interested in social
and political issues. Tanner doesn't have a solution to his dilemma because
there isn't one that will achieve what he most desires: a willingly well-informed
electorate. You can take a horse to water…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>Yet the evidence is there from recent history that as an
electorate we have good instincts. We were shocked by the drought and responded
when water restrictions were imposed. We voted for action on climate change and
our politicians let us down. An honest face is very powerful on television and
we recognize one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>Tony Windsor is a model. You don't need to agree with him to
believe he answers questions honestly. Malcolm Turnbull is admired by both
sides of politics for his principled stance on climate change policy. Tanner
was one of the few politicians who would answer a direct question and he won
respect for that. Undoubtedly his disappointment with the way he allowed
himself to be sucked into the media circus has led him to write this book. But
he absolves himself and other politicians too readily.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>The main problem is the extent to which politicians have bought
into the game the media organizations play. The media's purpose is clear and
they don't conceal it; they are chasing audiences. Politicians have a different
role to play; they are not in the entertainment business, they are elected to
govern the country. But too many are clearly suffering from the Laurie Oakes'
syndrome. They are as addicted to media coverage as are the political
journalists.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>For democracy to function we need politicians focused on policy.
As well we need an effective communications system that alerts us to the major
issues to be solved to live in a sustainable collaborative way on this planet.
A well-funded, independent ABC, not beholden to Government or any force, is
part of that mix.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>' Elite' is not a dirty word. It simply means a group of people
exercising the major share of authority within a larger society or organization
– like Parliament. In democratic institutions people have their say but leaders
must decide. The system may be flawed but it is the best idea we have managed
to come up with to govern societies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>The fact that the public are so turned off their politicians
provides the evidence that political behavior must change. Tanner provides data
showing the percentage of people watching the news is falling. Newspapers are
struggling for their existence; circulations are falling while population is
increasing. Young people are using social media and are the least likely
demographic group to follow politics. Given people are watching less and
reading less about politics why is it seen as imperative to play the media's
game?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>The people who decide elections are better informed than most and
there is evidence these people understand what is going on. They have lost
respect for both government and media institutions. So politicians need to
demonstrate leadership, get on with the job and stop play-acting in the media
circus. They should be setting the agenda not the media claque.</span></p>
