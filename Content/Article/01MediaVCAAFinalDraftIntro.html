    <p><strong>Discussion  Paper</strong><strong> </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Television,  Digital Media and children&rsquo;s learning</strong><strong> </strong></p>
    <p align="center"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
    <p>Modern technology  has transformed the way children learn and interact with their environment. </p>
    <p>The Victorian  Curriculum and Assessment Authority (VCAA) is responsible for the development  of the Victorian Early Learning and Development Framework 0&ndash;8 in partnership with  the Victorian Department of Education and Early Childhood Development.&nbsp; This paper was written in response to an  invitation from the VCAA to set out the writers&rsquo; views on the issue of the  potential of media technology to improve children&rsquo;s learning.<strong> </strong></p>
    <p>Part A of this  discussion paper examines how children use media technology and the educational  value of television, computers and electronic learning aids.&nbsp; Technology is available now and in the  immediate future that can be used to enhance children&rsquo;s learning.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Consideration is  given in Part B to the funding and regulatory issues needed to capitalise on the  potential of technology to transform development and learning for children. </p>
    <p>The definition  of media technology covers radio and  television broadcasting on in-house sets, iPods and portable players or on  mobile phones; films and TV programs, broadcast or on DVDs; computer games on  PCs, laptops or hand-held modules; interactive games on the internet; and communicative  media such as chat rooms, mobiles and  email.</p>
    <p>The paper  focuses on the youngest Australians, those aged up to eight who are significant  television viewers &ndash; in fact children under the age of four watch more  television than anybody else in the household. But they are currently often not  well served by television. </p>
