<p><strong>Navigating  a complex digital world </strong></p>

<p>Demographics,  politics and technology have changed the face of childhood. The new child faces  a world no adult has ever experienced and many are struggling to understand.  Family life has changed, parents and teachers no longer have a monopoly on  knowledge and children have the power to take charge, explore new media, create  and distribute their own productions. Teachers, parents and curriculum  developers must not ignore the implications of these changes for 21st  century learning.<br />
  The economic  model of infinite growth, along with its values of commercial greed and  consumerism, has collapsed under its own weight, with the unfortunate  consequence that less money can be allocated to the real education revolution  that is sorely needed. That collapse triggers policy responses driven by  productivity goals, measuring outcomes that are probably outmoded and which misread  the true revolutions already affecting children&rsquo;s lives.<br />
  Demographically,  children under 17 were already a minority (19.6%) of Australia&rsquo;s population by  2005.&nbsp; That minority status will make the  quality of children&rsquo;s education a burning political and social issue as the cost  of their education soars. Parents and children are caught in a wedge between  growing numbers of young adult Solos and ageing Baby Boomers. The Solos question  whether having children is a good idea in such gloomy times, do not see other  people&rsquo;s children as their responsibility and view workplace measures such as  parental leave and time flexibility for family reasons as discriminatory. The  aged have themselves had smaller families in good times and fear any expenditure  that could decrease the quality of life and levels of care they demand.<br />
  So those who  do have children are left to raise them privately, lavishing attention and  money on them, treating them as near-equals, fearful of denying them any chance  to succeed in a competitive market place. Children have fewer siblings, fewer  peers in their own neighborhoods and seek new avenues for social interaction  via mobile phones and the internet. Their learning reference point is not  parents or teachers, but global peers willing to exchange with them in new and exciting  ways.<br />
  It is here  that the education system is letting them down. We now know around 85% of a  child&rsquo;s core brain function develops before age five and the quality of those  early years is critical to life chances. Yet child care workers are poorly trained  and low-paid, access to quality care and kindergarten is limited and parents  are left to their own devices in stimulating their children in those early  years. Parenting, not community resources for childhood, becomes the focus.<br />
  Moreover,  our schools are still designed on an industrial model left behind in the  outside world. Individual learning, testing of fixed curriculum content and unequal  competition is valued over cooperative learning, team work, digital know-how  and adaptability. The old classroom still prevails, costing more than ever  because of reduced class sizes which have failed to improve &lsquo;productivity&rsquo; and  dominated by testing vaguely defined &lsquo;outcomes&rsquo; that narrow down the curriculum  to measurable units instead of encouraging inquiry, diversity and innovation.<br />
  Worse,  perhaps, many teachers fail to see that the nature of learning has itself  changed because of the ubiquity of new technology. The home is permeated by  mass media (&nbsp;&nbsp; ? hours watching screen at  age ?&nbsp;&nbsp; ) yet pre-school teachers ignore  the Montessori dictum that the classroom should be a reflection of the home,  the community and the wider world. Primary teachers from the outset of  television refused to see its learning potential, assuming it was just  entertainment, trivial, even harmful. And now the new media of mobile phones,  the internet, social websites, computer games have captured children&rsquo;s  imagination and motivation in ways few teachers ever can, but computer time is  rationed, games are vilified as harmful, the computer on every desk is seen as  just an add-on to teacher-directed lessons instead of the powerful learning  tool it really is.<br />
  Parents may  not be &lsquo;digital natives&rsquo; themselves but they increasingly recognize the power  of new media, for good or ill, and expect schools to guide children&rsquo;s use of  media tools effectively. Quality learning will become more of a focus, not  less, and private choice will drive changes in modes of learning, curriculum  content and the measurement of learning outcomes. As well, students will increasingly  outsmart teachers and want to control their own learning process. Lord Putnam  of Futurelab in the UK argues we should welcome, not fear this trend and allow  children to &lsquo;power-up&rsquo; the classroom and take more initiative for their own  learning. Since schooling is the child&rsquo;s &lsquo;work&rsquo;, why not see them as a powerful  new labor force for education, relieving teachers from what they feel is an  overcrowded curriculum and retraining so that teaching becomes more akin  to&nbsp; the role of navigator, guide, mentor,  not transmitting knowledge but challenging critical thought and the ability to  search, synthesise and build upon?<br />
  The digital  divide should not be allowed to exacerbate an already increasing education  divide between the privileged and the disadvantaged because inequality itself  is a key to all other social outcomes. <br />
  Instead of  debating whether the internet, YouTube, fist-person shooter games are good or  bad for children, we must recognize the horse has already bolted &ndash; children are  already engaged in, motivated by and taking control of the new technology for  their own purposes, both educational and social. We need to harness that  enthusiasm in the cause of quality learning and positive social values, not  leave the new media to the devices of a market more interested in profit than  in the future wellbeing of our children. <br />
  But that  will not happen if governments continue to treat the curriculum as something  that happens only in the school as we have known it, and fail to see that  communication policy, health policy, urban planning, the arts and environmental  policy are all part of what the new child of the 21st century needs  to survive and thrive. Linked policies integrated round the value and wellbeing  of future citizens - actively engaged in building quality of life, not just  being productive workers - should be the goal of a true education revolution in  Australia.</p>
