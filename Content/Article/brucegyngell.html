        <p><strong>Children's Media needs another Bruce Gyngell</strong><br />

    <p>There was nobody quite like Bruce  Gyngell, the first face we recall on Australian network television when Channel  Nine launched on the 16th of September   1956, 50 years ago. &ldquo;Good evening ladies and gentlemen, welcome to  television&rdquo;, he said. Typically Bruce claimed the first face seen was the  studio cat. </p>
    <p>Gyngell was described variously  throughout his career as a &ldquo;TV maverick' 'the most distinguished television  executive Australia  ever had known' and 'a TV terrorist'.&nbsp; He  was all of those things. As well he was seen as a traitor by the industry which  spawned him when his Tribunal imposed new standards for children's television  on the networks. </p>
    <p>The first time Gyngell saw  television, he was standing in Frank Packer's New York  office flicking through the channels.&nbsp;  'This is me' he said.&nbsp; That he  understood the medium and its audience was demonstrated throughout a brilliant  career where he led the Nine Network to dominate the ratings and then (following  a dispute with Sir Frank) did the same for the Seven Revolution.</p>
    <p>But he did not understand the  bureaucracy. The Fraser government with Kerry Packer's support appointed  Gyngell to run the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; a decision both would come  to regret.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Gyngell's first task as Chairman  was to undertake an inquiry into the concept of self regulation for  broadcasters and to decide on the extent of regulation of Australian content,  children's program and advertising standards.&nbsp;  The industry was confident of the outcome. But Gyngell proved to be his  own man, not an industry puppet. He listened as public interest groups came  forward to argue the case for children's television and he decided the industry  should produce and transmit quality children's programs.</p>
    <p>I was a former member of the  Australian Broadcasting Control Board - sacked (in 1976) when Malcolm Fraser  came to power - who had gained a name as a forceful advocate for children's  programming. Undeterred by my reputation Bruce invited me to join his  Tribunal's Children's Program Committee to devise the regulations. I chaired  the CPC for the next five years and during Gyngell's term had his full support  for the introduction of children's program standards which are still in place  today. </p>
    <p>The industry could not believe  their favourite son had betrayed them. The dispute between the CPC and the  Tribunal, with the Federation of Children's Television Stations (FACTS) and the  Networks, was acrimonious&nbsp;  as we ventured into a regulatory experiment untried anywhere else  in the world. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;Through those Program Standards Australian  children heard their voices, saw their stories set in their landscape, and an  international industry was born with Australian children's drama becoming  renowned and screened around the world.</p>
    <p>It was a far-sighted policy and a  case study of the way in which politics can be unpredictable when you mix a  maverick like Bruce Gyngell with a bureaucracy, commercial interests and  consumer groups.&nbsp; Bruce described the  public hearings he chaired as 'a circus', with 'television groupies' gathering  each time a licence was to be renewed. He provoked critics and admirers and in  the process attracted attention, so the public knew more about broadcasting and  the performance of the networks during his tenure than they had in the  industry's 25 year history. </p>
    <p>The networks and the government  could not cope with the exposure and although Bruce put himself up for  reappointment the government opted for a quieter time appointing David Jones, a  partner in the legal firm of Ellison, Hewison and Whitehead as the Tribunal's  next Chairman to settle the public license renewal process and contain the CPC  with its ambitious plans for children.</p>
    <p>Gyngell was appointed managing  director of the new Independent and Multi-cultural Broadcasting Corporation  later to become SBS and took his style and considerable understanding of the  industry to that role. His like has not been seen again in broadcasting or  media regulation.</p>
    <p>The program standards Gyngell's ABT  recommended in 1977, and implemented in June 1979 are  now undergoing review by the Australian Communications and Media Authority  (ACMA) chaired by Chris Chapman. A lawyer and seasoned media executive with  broad experience in broadcasting, on-line and telecommunications, Chapman has  arrived relatively quietly on the regulatory scene as the inaugural Chair and  CEO earlier this year (Feb 27). Word has it he is an innovator who believes  communications have an important social role to play. Time will tell.</p>
    <p>Although there have been  substantial variations to the standards over 25 years there has been no review  of the assumptions underlying children's programming policy. The objective of  the standard is to ensure that children have access to a diversity of quality  television programs made specifically for them. With the development of new  media, children's interests are moving away from conventional formats and free  to air television and there are significant social changes apparent in this  shift. </p>
    <p>The children's media debate is  crying out for new champions and hopefully this review will uncover them for  there is little discussion about the content of programs needed for children  anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp; Public interest groups have  narrowed their focus - to advertising and the old chestnut 'violence'-&nbsp; in the belief the  task of ensuring program content is successfully accomplished.&nbsp;&nbsp; Producers - the beneficiaries of a system of  regulation and subsidy - have not had to argue the case for the needs of  children. Their time has now come as ACMA's role is not to preserve their  interests; it is to ensure the needs of children will be served by the new  media environment.</p>
    <p>Children's media today does not  simply mean television (although that should remain a significant area for new  development, and the networks should not be permitted to abdicate their  responsibilities).&nbsp; There are many new  technology platforms. Children are both familiar with them and keen to explore  every new possibility.&nbsp; They still use  books, magazines and audiotapes but they engage with MP3 players, animation,  computer games, SMS pagers and mobile phones. They are adept at multitasking  not just using one device at a time. </p>
    <p>Producers of children's programs  are yet to embrace new technologies; their programs are often tired, lacking  ideas, innovation and excitement for their audience, too often based around  characters for their merchandise potential rather than ideas capable of  stimulating and educating their audience.</p>
    <p>ACMA should conduct a review which  looks forward to the next decade. Media offer wonderful opportunities to  educate and inspire.&nbsp; We should not give  up on the idea of shaping the communication technology, of continuing to lead  in the production of media for children as we have done for two decades in Australia.  We can continue to create, together with children, stories that will bring the  children around the world to an understanding of one another.</p>
    <p>The times cry out for another Bruce  Gyngell: Chris Chapman are you the man?</p>
