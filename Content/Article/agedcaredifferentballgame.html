                There is an obvious conflict of interests in
                any care industry where profits have to be made and returned to shareholders,
                rather than ploughed back into better care. Profit is never a good incentive
                for the common good. It's easier to cut back on staff, food quality, proper
                supervision and social activity for those in care, while ramping up schemes
                that confuse people about entry and exit costs in aged care homes and deny
                families peace of mind and financial justice. Lack of enforcement of proper
                standards means the providers too often get away with it.&nbsp;

            The recently revealed scandalous treatment of older people in
            both retirement living and aged care calls for a serious rethinking of the aged

            Although many people believe that all "old" people live in
            nursing homes, in Australia only 7.8% (270,559) people over 65 are actually in
            residential aged care. Another 7% (184,000) are living in retirement villages.
            Because we are living longer and have a healthier lifestyle, the years of
            disability-free living have increased by 5 years and most people are not in
            need of institutional care until the last few years of their life. &nbsp;But if
            they need care and support as they get older, a rich country like Australia
            should be able to provide the highest quality end of life experience. There
            should be no opportunity for rip off schemes in retirement villages or neglect
            and cruelty such as that reported by Michael Blanchard in&nbsp;

            The 7.1 million Australians already in the age group 50-75
            (middle age, rising to 9 million by 2031) will demand a better deal as they get
            older and governments at every level will have to respond more carefully. So
            too will the 2.7 million (rising to 3.9 million) people aged 65-79. They'll
            want something very different. Moreover, this middle-ageing group is used to
            getting what they want, not just what others decide for them. They are well
            educated, healthy and productive. So in planning for old age they won't want a
            paternalistic system of aged care. They'll demand a system of flexible,
            adaptable support as they shift from fully independent living to wanting help
            tailored to their particular needs.

            Aged care in Australia is heavily subsidised by government and
            recent reforms actively encourage a free market model&nbsp;&nbsp; This free
            market model has the advantage of empowering consumers as (at least in theory)
            it gives them a choice about care providers. The new consumer-driven aged care
            packages (Commonwealth Home Support) mean that an older person can pay for precisely
            what they want, not what someone else thinks they need. If you want to be
            driven to the shopping centre you can be, you don't have to accept having your
            kitchen cleaned up, even if it needs to be. Loneliness is the biggest killer
            and companionship, having someone to listen to you (not necessarily even to
            have an equal conversation with) may be more important than being helped in the
            shower. People can now tailor their own package and dismiss carers with whom
            they have no rapport. The problem is where there is no choice, as in rural
            areas, or where the older person and their family is not able to make an
            informed choice due to cognitive decline, lack of literacy or exposure to rip
            off schemes. After all, you are not likely to look for aged care until you need
            it due to significant physical or mental decline.

            But the free market model also encourages competition and the
            clever disrupters are already showing the big players that outdated assumptions
            and shoddy practices will not be profitable in the future. &nbsp;There are some
            inspiring international examples. The Intergenerational learning centre in
            Seattle (built 1991) combines pre-school care with aged care, with 125 children
            (ages 0 – 5) and 400+ aged residents. Numerous studies have linked social
            interaction with decreased loneliness, delayed mental decline, lower blood
            pressure and reduced risk of disease and death in elders. Socializing across
            generations has also been shown to increase the amount of smiling and
            conversation among older adults. As well as reductions in ageism with younger
            generations.

            Dutch nursing homes are offering free accommodation to
            university students in return for acting as a neighbour for aged care residents
            in their 80s and 90s. Students teach skills in technology, and have social time
            with residents. The program reaches over 500 aged care residents and helps
            reduce the effects of loneliness, improves social skills, technological skills,
            improved levels of happiness through familiarity, increased recollection of
            past memories through such things as poetry.

            Ageing in place is the current name of the game, but we could go
            further. There is room for new forms of inter-generational aged care homes,
            where young and old share accommodation, either in a purpose-built complex such
            as those above or as with the HomeShare program which carefully matches up
            older people living alone with young students in need of cheap housing in
            return for help around the house and garden, or with other chores. The results
            are positive for both the older person and their younger companions.

            The essential quality of a good carer is an ability to
            communicate and empathise with the person in their care. So, poor English
            language skills or a purely instrumental attitude will not suffice. Nor will an
            English-speaking carer do for an Italian or Chinese older person. It will have
            to be horses for courses, and all care training courses must emphasise the
            personal relationship side of caring. Middle-aged people in search of a
            meaningful but not full-time job may well have more appropriate life experience
            and emotional intelligence than young trainees.

            Given that most aged care is already carried out by family
            members, media stirring about intergenerational conflict doesn't help. The aged
            have contributed to society, helped their offspring and grandchildren through a
            lifetime. The middle-aged are supporting their&nbsp;millennial adult children
            as well as their ageing parents. That intergenerational exchange is a guide to
            better policies in all aspects of aged care, even once the few who may need it
            move out of the family home into institutional care.
