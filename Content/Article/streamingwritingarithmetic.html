<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Over the summer holidays our family was
treated to the world premiere of a little-known Australian film, <i>The School
Hacking Internet Team</i> (or the S.H.I.T. Team). The film was about a school
principal who refuses to allow internet use in her school. The team, in
exposing her dictatorial edict, discovers she is a terrorist and armaments
trader. They foil her dire plans and in the process blow up the school. Order
and internet use are restored.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>It's a funny, entertaining spoof of the
big-budget <i>Mission Impossible</i> genre, produced by four kids aged eight to
14 who collaborated intermittently over a year. The film involved
story-boarding, building elaborate props, downloading software and creating
special effects, all done with no adults involved. It was a mission to master
technology. A mission of love.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>This growing love affair between our
children and the media has been recently documented in a study by the US Kaiser
Family Foundation, entitled <i>Generation M2: Media in the Lives of 8 to
18-Year-Olds</i>, published in January. This is the third report in a project
on media usage indicating the phenomenal commitment young people have to new
technology, and the explosion in the amount of time they are spending in its
company.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The Kaiser study concludes that American
young people spend seven hours and 38 minutes consuming media each day. That is
an extraordinary amount of time to be doing anything - more than spent in
school - and no one makes them do this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Including multitasking - using more than
one medium at a time - young people, on average, pack a total of 10 hours and
45 minutes' worth of media content into their daily 7½ hours' usage. American
young people are not alone. Research by the Australian Communication and Media
Authority two years earlier cited similar figures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Last year I mentioned this phenomenon at
a conference of children's television producers in Britain and there were cries
of disbelief. That doesn't happen here, they said. But indeed it does. A 2008
report by communications regulator Ofcom found the same high media usage among
children in the UK.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Such numbers produce fear among
teachers, parents and policymakers. How can we stop this, they ask. Children's
brains will be damaged: they won't be able to concentrate or think. They will
be at risk from paedophiles and profiteers, have no social and ethical values.
Nations will fall and civilisation as we know it will end. Of course there are risks,
both in the real world and the virtual world. But evidence needs to replace
emotion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Fear and panic obscure the fact that
with change comes opportunity. Remember the Biro? Teachers feared it would ruin
handwriting, and banned its use in schools. But the Biro won out and the filthy
work of ink monitors disappeared. It's time once more to seize the day with new
technology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Instead of seeing the internet as the
enemy, educators could use this unstoppable phenomenon to successfully target a
notoriously elusive demographic - the pre and early pubescent adolescent
entering the age of defiance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The highest levels of media consumption
are in the tween and early teen years, 11 to 14-year-olds. This group has
always been notoriously difficult to reach through children's television
programs. It is the age when peer influences lead to challenging parental
wisdom, with kids wanting to spend more time with their friends than with their
parents.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Mobile devices and online communities
offer unprecedented opportunities to this age group to fraternise with groups
outside the home who fit with their interests and developmental needs. They
also offer a resource to educators.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>True, a minority of youth who are heavy
media users in the Kaiser study report lower grades and lower levels of
personal contentment. However, this is only significant when use exceeds 16
hours a day. Most children's grades aren't suffering. How is that so? I - along
with others including the Federation of American Scientists (which has issued a
statement supporting the use of computer and video games in classrooms) -
suspect it is because children are learning more than we know from the new
media.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>This recent explosion in media usage is
a story about technology facilitating consumption. Today a sizeable portion (20
per cent) of media use occurs on mobile devices - mobile phones, iPods or
hand-held video game players. The Kaiser study reports that time spent playing
video games has increased by about 24 minutes daily over the past five years
and that 20 minutes of that increase is through these mobile devices. Time
spent listening to music and other audio has increased by more than
three-quarters of an hour a day to just over 2½ hours. Nearly an hour of that
listening occurs via a mobile phone or an iPod, and another 30 minutes is
streamed via the computer through programs such as iTunes or internet radio.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>For the first time since the Kaiser
Foundation began this research in 1999, the amount of time young people spend
watching regularly scheduled programming on a television set at the time it is
broadcast has declined - by 25 minutes a day. However, the proliferation of new
ways of consuming content means that, overall, TV viewing has increased by 38
minutes a day over the past five years, with the additional viewing being done
over the internet, mobile phones and iPods. In addition to mobile media, online
media are changing young people's lives. With the expansion of higher-speed
home internet access, the availability of television content online, and the development
of social networking sites such as Facebook and attractive applications
including YouTube and Twitter, today's eight to 18-year-olds spend an average
of 1½ hours daily using the computer outside school work. These figures can
only increase with improved computer and internet access.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The growth is exponential. You Tube,
launched in 2005 with a video clip, now offers millions of hours of free
audiovisual content. Facebook was launched in February 2004 and had about 1500
registered members within 24 hours. In September 2006 it opened to all those
aged 13 and over. Twitter, created in 2006, is the SMS of the internet. These
sites currently account for an average of 37 minutes of young people's daily
media time - 22 for social networking and 15 minutes for browsing video sites.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The purpose of the Kaiser research is to
offer a reliable basis for policymakers to craft national media policies, for
parents trying to do their best to stay on top of their children's media
habits, and for educators, advocates and public health groups who are concerned
with the impact of media on youth, and want to exploit the educational and
informational potential of media in young people's lives.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The TV shows children watch, video games
they play, songs they listen to, books they read and websites they visit -
which fill a staggeringly large part of their lives - offer a constant stream
of messages about families, peers, relationships, gender roles, sex, violence,
food, values, clothes - advice about everything they encounter in life. The
education potential is massive but, as the media response to Lord Carter's 2009
<i>Report on Digital Britain</i> stated, we need to move from ''the pipes to
the poetry''.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Important as the protection issues are,
we are doing far too little to harness the potential that this youth
infatuation with media provides. Government has intervened in the past for good
purpose, establishing successful policies for the funding and distribution of
children's television and Australian content. Educators should now be urged to
engage with media producers to utilise this technology to develop resources to
help young people learn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The ABC is calling for ideas for its
digital channel that are cheap to produce and long running, as filling the
schedule becomes the priority. But programming created to fill a schedule is
not an answer for 21st-century children. The needs and interests of young
people should dictate the program content and the form of the programs that are
being produced, particularly when they are produced with public money. That
trend is now towards mobile technology, multi-player games and user-generated
content such as the S.H.I.T. Team.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Australia needs a Centre for the
Development of Innovative Media for Children and Youth. The UK has made a start
with FutureLab, an agency dedicated to furthering innovation in education
through new practices and new technologies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The Joan Ganz Cooney Centre in New York
was established in 2007 to focus on the question: ''How do new media help
children learn?'' The World Summit on Media for Children, a triennial event
that originated in Melbourne, will meet in Karlstad, Sweden, in June this year.
This summit will be about the future of the media industries and their
relationship with education and development, about a new global vision for
children and media and education, centred on digital technology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>In the meantime, Australia's education
revolution needs to focus on new directions for media and education policy. The
media revolution is not just about faster broadband, mobile and universal
access to computers and mobile phones. It must be about content. There is no
stopping our kids' media love affair. Their relationship with media has changed
forever.</span></p>
