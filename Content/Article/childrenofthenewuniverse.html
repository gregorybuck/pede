    <p><strong>Children of the new universe need a real education revolution</strong></p>
    <p>Patricia Edgar published in <em>The Age</em> September 1, 2008</p>
    <p>Almost every day the media report disastrous stories about  kids who are out of control, too fat, too sexy, disrespectful, too full of themselves for their own good, with parents and  teachers concerned about their children's future</p>
    <p>Who is this new child? And how do we raise children to be  intelligent, optimistic and confident of their own abilities, without turning  them into self-centred, arrogant little individuals  are not concerned with the wider&nbsp; common  good, </p>
    <p>Children are now a minority group.&nbsp; Most start life with two loving parents, but  one in five lives in a one-parent family and one in four will spend at least  part of their life in such an arrangement.&nbsp;  The new child has older parents, generally both working, who want to be  their friends rather than wise elders or authority figures.&nbsp; There are fewer siblings so family life  involves more adult-talk, adult-see, adult-copy as the  gap between generations recedes.</p>
    <p>Because of a declining birth rate there are fewer peers  around and more time is spent alone or in arms-length relationships with  virtual friends.&nbsp; The new child spends up  to seven hours a day on computers, mobile phones, Ipods  and interactive gaming, using technologies their parents do not always  understand and entering virtual worlds their parents cannot always navigate.</p>
    <p>It's not so much the amount of time they spend using media  that is concerning as it is their bombardment with damaging messages about  promiscuous sexuality,unhealthy food  and drink products, and celebrity role models who are personally out of control  and whose lives set a salacious model for&nbsp;  child behaviour . </p>
    <p>The new child - divided into target groups of teens, tweens and babies - has become a consumer. The free market is&nbsp; contemptuous of  these children and their parents, ruthlessly exploiting children's new found  spending power and parents' anxieties about how to do the best they can for  their 'baby Einsteins'. The words we now use to talk  about the media we produce for children come from the sales and marketing  domain - 'product', 'consumer', 'brand' and 'platform'.&nbsp; We don't talk about the content of programs anymore, we talk about the merchandise potential.</p>
    <p>In the world of education we still talk about 'children' but  teachers and many parents are falling way behind in mastering the educational  changes in teaching and learning new media herald. Rudd's Education Revolution  recognizes the power and ubitquity of computer  technology, but fails to understand the huge role media content plays in  children's lives and the education potential that therefore exists to use media  in all its forms as a resource for formal education. </p>
    <p><b>Instead the mass  media are permitted to operate counter to the best interests of children, in  effect undermining values, healthy lifestyles and the authority of parents. The  positive contribution new media can make to learning is ignored as we worry  about time wasting on games, porn Web sites and stranger danger lurking through  the Web</b></p>
    <p>Today's children will be financially dependent on their  parents for much longer than ever before but they will expect an independence  in decision-making most offspring have never had, taking risks with alcohol, drugs,  money and sexuality, early in life, without the emotional maturity to always  handle the consequences.&nbsp; Close to a  third of them will never marry but they'll have plenty of experience of serial  short-term relationships.</p>
    <p>One third of children will fall at the bottom of the heap  with parents unable to afford to educate, feed and house them properly, or to  guide their behaviour in positive directions.&nbsp; These are the children we should most worry  about.</p>
    <p>There is a growing sense of powerlessness on the part of  adults which leaves children vulnerable to hedonism, indulgence and neglect,  with adults unable to put pressure on governments to act on behalf of the  well-being of all children.</p>
    <p>Australia  still fails to deal with children in a way that guarantees a sound future for  every child. Governments don't fully understand that the new child is growing  up in a new world of unstable family life, new media influences, new workplace  demands on parents, so policies affecting children need to be integrated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Child policy is all over the place falling  between the cracks of a messy political system.&nbsp;  Child care, education, health and workplace policy is part Federal, part  State, part local government, partly privatized. Media policy for children is  dealt with separately from education reform. Decisions are not made to ensure  all these areas work together to help children develop and thrive. </p>
    <p>We need a new approach underscored by a more positive view  of children and their capacity to cope with the challenges of modern life.</p>
    <p>We need grown-ups who are smarter activists on behalf of  children and smarter in the ways they interact with and manage the lives of the  new child</p>
    <p>We need a Federal Minister for Children to coordinate  policy- making across various government departments, and to control the  quality of early childhood care and preschool education across the nation.</p>
    <p>We need a systematic program of parent education and  support, a renewal of parent confidence; better information about child  development, including the need for limit-setting, effort, mastery; their right  to demand better support from government on every front.</p>
    <p>All primary schools should be redesigned and funded as  Family Learning Centres, linking child care,  pre-schooling, family support services, such as maternal and child health and  parent education across local and regional areas. </p>
    <p>Urban planning should take into account the physical and  social needs of children and families aimed at promoting a healthy lifestyle  and respect for others.</p>
    <p>A complete re-training and reorientation of teachers is  needed so they understand the changed family circumstances of the new child;  their vital role as models, mentors and guides for children in a complex world;  understand the new research on brain development, effort and mastery; and the  potential of new media for children's learning and social development.</p>
    <p>In short the new child deserves smarter adults at every  level, who are thinking more carefully about how current policies and programs  could be improved and better linked.</p>
    <p>Kids today are exhuberant,  perceptive and inventive. They know their way around and it's our job to give  them the resilience and resources they need so they have the best chance in  life to deal with the problems we bequeath them.</p>
