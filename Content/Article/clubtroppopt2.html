            When ABC television first aired,
            on November 5, 1956, children's programs presented a dilemma. There was no
            Australian film production industry, and video tape was yet to be invented. The
            highly successful radio program&nbsp;<i>The Argonauts</i>&nbsp;was not suited
            to visual adaptation so the public broadcaster settled on a studio-based&nbsp;<i>
                Children's
                TV Club,
            </i>featuring paintings, photography and puppets. The program could not
            compete with&nbsp;<i>The Happy Show</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Tarax Show</i>&nbsp;on
            the commercial stations which lured children with giveaways. But&nbsp;<i>
                Mr
                Squiggle
            </i>&nbsp;did. A puppet with a pencil for a nose made drawings out of
            squiggly lines sent in by young viewers, and developed as an imaginative and
            successful children's entertainment screened on the ABC for a quarter of a
            century.

            During the first two television
            decades the ABC excelled with its educational programs, and by the
            mid-seventies more than 80 percent of schools carried ABC broadcasts.&nbsp;<i>

            its life on the BBC in 1964 and was sold to Australia, Canada and New Zealand
            before production began locally in July 1966. The BBC kept a proprietorial eye
            on its progeny and their producers claimed then (and the Australian producers
            have consistently claimed since) that they held the holy-grail for
            pre-schoolers. However the program derives from an English middle-class model
            for conforming children, which does not challenge their thinking. Although it
            is now lauded as an icon, the tenacity with which the&nbsp;<i>Play School</i>&nbsp;team
            have defended their enterprise has undermined the potential of ABC children's
            programming and production in Australia for decades. What we have learned about
            child development in more than fifty years has gone largely ignored by the
            program.

            The first major dispute came in
            1971 when the ABC purchased<i>&nbsp;Sesame Street,&nbsp;</i>a thoroughly
            researched and engaging program designed to help teach American disadvantaged
            children basic language and number concepts and stimulate their imaginations.
            There was vitriolic protest from the&nbsp;<i>Play School&nbsp;</i>education
            team which claimed&nbsp;<i>Sesame Street&nbsp;</i>would undermine the language
            development of Australian children and shorten their attention spans.<i>

            oppose the purchase. But fortunately,&nbsp;<i>Play School</i>&nbsp;lost this
            round and&nbsp;<i>Sesame Street&nbsp;</i>went to air on the ABC bringing some
            diversity and a creative program to young viewers.

            Part of the reason for the emotional blood feud that has been
            generated over program purchases has been the tug-of-war between in-house
            producers and the independent production industry. The former can make programs
            without regard to the viewers they might attract, whereas the independents are
            more market driven. Both compete for a share of the budget.

            In 1987 Paddy Conroy, who had been
            Head of ABC Children's Programs, became Head of Television under David Hill as
            Managing Director. He had insight into the workings of the children's area and
            thought the department and its educational programs had become moribund. With
            the exception of&nbsp;<i>Behind the News,</i>&nbsp;the education programs had
            lost appeal and were no longer used widely in schools. With his new authority,
            Conroy set out to refresh ABC programming generally. He wanted to shake up
            in-house production, flush out tired entrenched staff, bring in independent
            productions, but also generate revenue for the broadcaster which was always
            under siege from both sides of politics.

            The ABC Board's policy at the time
            was to reduce in-house production and work more with the independent sector to
            reduce overheads. Conroy axed funding for the Schools' Service, and appointed
            Nick Collis-George to reform the department. Collis-George, a tough-minded
            union man was briefed by Conroy to sack those resisting change, encourage
            independent production, look into merchandising&nbsp;<i>Play School</i>, and
            generally change the profile of children's television on the ABC.

            The Australian Children's Television Foundation, set up in 1982,
            was the obvious choice for the ABC to work with in order to become the leading
            producer of children's programs. As Director of the ACTF, I welcomed the
            partnership. Conroy put in place an output deal with the ACTF which enabled the
            development of first class drama series by the Foundation, secure in the
            knowledge there was a guaranteed broadcaster in place, with respect for the
            product and a mutual interest in its success.

            This partnership helped raise the
            profile of Australian children's programs. Both domestically and
            internationally, the production industry flourished off the back of the
            reputation of successful programs, which included&nbsp;<i>Touch the Sun,</i>&nbsp;the
            Bi- Centennial feature film series made in each State, including the Emmy award-winning&nbsp;<i>
                Captain
                Johnno
            </i>. Through the output deal, the ABC acquired&nbsp;<i>Winners&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>
                Round
                the Twist&nbsp;
            </i>from the commercial networks and both these shows went into
            further series. In 1994, the International Year of the Family, the ABC and ACTF
            launched&nbsp;<i>Family Album</i>&nbsp;which went to air at 6.00 pm each
            Saturday night throughout the year as a celebration of family life, allowing
            families to share viewing in prime time.

            The&nbsp;<i>Play School</i>&nbsp;team
            was unhappy about the partnership between the ABC and the ACTF and when Conroy
            decided to buy&nbsp;<i>Lift Off</i>, a program for three to eight-year-olds,
            the animosity burst forth like lava from a volcano. He was interested in
            diversity and in the development of a sustainable, independent, Australian
            production which would fill a gap in the market and balance imported
            programming. Conroy wanted to go beyond&nbsp;<i>Play School&nbsp;</i>which he
            considered out-dated. The BBC had cancelled their&nbsp;<i>Play School&nbsp;</i>in
            1988 to progress new ideas. Canada had followed, as did New Zealand.

            In February 1991, when the ABC
            Board was considering funding&nbsp;<i>Lift-Off</i>, the schools faction began a
            strident campaign. Alan Kendall, for seventeen years an executive producer in
            the Early Childhood Unit which oversaw the production of&nbsp;<i>Play School</i>,
            wrote a thirty-page report to the Board passionately defending&nbsp;<i>
                Play
                School&nbsp;
            </i>and condemning the principles expressed in the&nbsp;<i>Lift-Off&nbsp;</i>document

font-family:"Georgia","serif";color:#333333'>
            Kendall claimed that the ACTF had
            no idea what it was doing by targeting the three-to eight-year-old audience
            within one program. He claimed that the&nbsp;<i>Lift-Off&nbsp;</i>approach was
            'doctrinaire' and would threaten the security of three-to-four-year-olds,
            creating 'jagged attention patterns like&nbsp;<i>Sesame Street</i>'. With
            evangelical fervour, Kendall extolled the virtues of&nbsp;<i>Play School&nbsp;</i>as
            'the only program in the world which understood how to reach young children
            directly through its on-air presenter'. 'More than anything else,' he said,
            'the&nbsp;<i>Lift-Off&nbsp;</i>proposal is an attack on the medium of
            television … I am alarmed at the possibility that the same corrosion of
            television values in the children's field could begin to happen within the ABC
            itself.'&nbsp;

                Street&nbsp;
            </i>twenty years earlier. Collis-George wrote to me seeking urgent
            comments on the paper. I declined this invitation because the central issue
            Kendall was addressing was not in contention.&nbsp;<i>Lift-Off</i>&nbsp;was not
            an attempt to compete with&nbsp;<i>Play School</i>. It was unnecessary to
            denigrate one program to preserve the other. They targeted different
            demographics and it was a shocking fact that twenty years had gone by with no
            thought given by the ABC to the development of a new major Australian program
            for early childhood.

            Kendall also missed the point that
            it was time the schools, the community and the broadcasters worked together in
            a concerted way for children. Technology was evolving. The distinctions between
            film, television, video, audio tapes and publishing were breaking down and
            programming needed to use the potential offered to educate children. Kendall
            reflected the difference between the old child development views of the
            clinical psychologist Jean Piaget - who when working in the 1930's theorised
            there were fixed stages in child development - and Harvard University Professor
            Howard Gardner, who is regarded as the foremost thinker in developmental
            psychology in the US, and did the seminal work on multiple intelligences.&nbsp;

            youngsters as thinking, feeling human beings, and to encourage them to use
            their minds and to express and realize their feelings to the fullest', he
            wrote. 'And so, to be informed rather than irrelevant, opposition to&nbsp;<i>Lift-Off&nbsp;</i>…
            needs to argue 'children are either too young to use their minds' or, 'It is

            While Disney began marketing
            Mickey Mouse as far back as the 1920s, it was not until the advent of
            children's channels, such as Nickelodeon (1977) and Disney (1983) in the US,
            that brands became more important than individual programs. The success of

            producers around the globe. It wasn't long before the public broadcasters,

            The series originated as a popular song, featured on the UK Play

            was to generate revenue. Now viewed in over 70 countries, Bananas in Pyjamas is
            the ABC's most successful overseas product. While the program would not exist

            By deciding to commercialise their children's characters the ABC
            was on a slippery slope, which inevitably led to conflict with child advocates
            and brought into question the public broadcaster's role. The Charter requires
            the ABC to treat 'its audience as citizens, not consumers' and 'provide
            innovative and comprehensive services which contribute to a sense of national

            about citizenship, about nationhood, about ensuring Australian children grew up
            hearing Australian voices and Australian stories.' They asserted ABC3 would
            achieve 50 per cent Australian content. It would be on air from 6.00 am to 9.00
            pm each day which meant 5,460 hours of programming had to be acquired, repeated

            A digital children's channel is a
            demanding distribution system: two channels, ABC2 and ABC3, had to be scheduled

            programming sought, lies in their press releases. The following is but one
            example. At the SPAA Conference in 12 August, 2009, ABC Children's Television

            The ABC, however, is a vital player in our democratic and
            cultural life. It is imperative that the ABC be sustained and that it plays the
            important role it could and should in the service and development of children.
            Unfortunately, the ABC is capable of destroying itself. By dumbing down its
            content, sacrificing innovation and depth for program filler, pleas for funding
            can be more easily ignored and a legitimate question can be asked about the quality
            of its programs. The ABC is presented with a double bind - how to develop
            quality programs when it is under attack with a strong campaign to cut back or
            even abolish our public broadcaster. This confusion about its role and values
            is no more strongly in evidence than in its children's programming.

            The ABC needs to be reminded of its mission to treat 'its
            audience (including children) as citizens, not consumers' and 'provide
            innovative and comprehensive services which contribute to a sense of national identity,
            inform, educate, entertain and reflect Australian cultural diversity.' Market
            share in competition with commercial television should not be the measure of
            success, nor should the public broadcaster be called on to fill all the gaps
            that can be found in children's programming.

            The ABC should return to its philosophical roots, expressed in
            the Charter, and apply them to the modern age. Technology is demonstrating the
            sharpness and capabilities of children's minds. They have been totally
            underestimated, condescended to and exploited by most television programs made
            for them. Even two-year-olds can master a notebook and learn from the media.
            The ABC's role should be to link media with child development. There is massive
            potential for media and education to come together in the interests of children
            and for the Government to fund, from both Communication and Education
            Departments, the important role the ABC should be playing in the development of
            young children. We know Australians want the ABC protected. Many would go to
            the barricades to ensure that it is. I would be among them.
