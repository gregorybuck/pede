        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>American National Institute of Ageing studies show that negative
stereotypes about ageing, images of the elderly as &quot;senile&quot;,
&quot;frail&quot;, or confused, can become debilitating, self-fulfilling
prophecies. Seeing or hearing gloomy examples&nbsp; about what it is like to be
old can make people walk more slowly, hear and remember less well, and even
affect their cardiovascular system, affecting health and longevity.&nbsp;</span>

        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>That result is unsurprising. Tell anyone, at any age, they are a
burden, with nothing to contribute and they will begin to believe and act
accordingly. It's like pointing the bone.</span>

        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>Despite the resoundingly negative commentaries from economists, resilient
older Australians are proving them wrong, many living to be 100&nbsp; (if not
150) without being a burden.&nbsp;</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>Over the last 35 years the so-called dependency burden has
actually fallen. Older Australians have increased their contribution to the
labour force. As well baby boomers do not form a unique bulge in the population
pyramid. The group&nbsp; following the baby boomers is&nbsp; larger so will
increase numbers in the paid labour force.</span>

        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>So how do we correct the myths and develop responsible and
productive policies? We should start with a new definition of ageing.&nbsp;</span>

        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>When is someone old? &nbsp;Life expectancy above 30 is a very
modern phenomenon driven by public health measures and falling infant
mortality. Life expectancy at birth only reached 35 in Sweden shortly before
1700; in Italy around 1880; and in Russia around 1910. In Australia today, life
expectancy for men who are 65 is 85 and for women it is 89. The aged represent
the fastest growing demographic in society.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>Yet we are still bogged down in the perception that 50 is the
beginning of old age. South Australia's Ageing Plan has been based on
interviews with Australians over 50. At that age we are entering &quot;the
second half of life&quot;, not heading for the scrap heap. So by treating this
stage as a period of obsolescence we are creating a non-existent problem and
undermining a resource which could have significant benefit for society.&nbsp;</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>In the '50s&nbsp; Americans identified adolescents or teenagers as
a group distinct from children, with special needs. It made sense developmentally
to split the demographic of children into two distinct groups as childhood was
prolonged with schooling extended; children&nbsp; living with parents longer,
entering the workforce later, marrying later and their life expectancy
increasing proportionally.&nbsp;</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>It's time to recognise middle age, like childhood, is now lived in
two stages. We have evolved to a point where the first stage involves work and
the second, activity before old age. We don't stop work, then die as we did in
the early 1900s. Retirement now is from the paid labour force but not from
life. It is a time of maturity, when we have been broadened by experience. It
is a time for generativity, when we can give back and find satisfaction in a
range of activities.</span>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>This is already happening through volunteering, caring,
intergenerational contributions such as childcare and mentoring but these
contributions are not recognised and valued. They don't count in the GDP, but
no strong community can exist without them and this is the way of life now.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>The inter-generational warfare promoted in some sections of the
media is another counter-productive myth. It is a rare family where the
interests of the young are not the over-riding concern of parents and
grandparents. Income flows from the old to the young more than the other way
around, a fact that is overlooked.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>It isn't difficult to see that two clear age groups are being
confused and the attributes of the very old are being conferred way too early.
&nbsp;Given our increased life expectancy the term &quot;old&quot; should
perhaps mean someone over 85, not 65 and certainly not 55.&nbsp;</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>Social, medical and cultural policy needs to catch up with this
dramatic change in our life cycle.&nbsp;</span>

        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>We have got to stop talking about retirement and &quot;having a
well-deserved rest&quot;. Working until the age of 70, if the jobs are there
and discrimination in the workforce ceases, makes sense. &nbsp;The reason is
not simply to ease an economic burden, but to prevent decline where, for too
many, retirement leads to cognitive, emotional and physical deterioration.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>People in a late-stage career or living an active life after 55
have much to give. We need to think about Life Part 2, about redesigning our
long life journey. A growing body of research suggests that health and
satisfaction in the second half of life, the opportunity to re-invent
ourselves, are critically tied to education and engagement, but we are used to
thinking that education is for the young. Instead we need to think about
education as a life-long process.&nbsp;</span>

        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>The claim that 1.8 million Australians will have to rely on public
expenditure to live is ill informed. The choice is ours to make. We are
experiencing a longevity revolution which, with will and imagination, has
exciting potential for the wellbeing of all.</span>
