                        <p><strong>Don   Edgar</strong><strong></strong></p>
                        <p><strong>('Waves of Change  Conference, Southern </strong><strong>Western</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Port</strong><strong> Regional Council of Adult Community and  Further Education - Rosebud, 31 May, 2001)</strong><br />
                        </p>
                        <p>Your conference theme is 'Waves of Change - Surfing for  Survival'. I'm afraid I find that somewhat passive and reactive, and I want to  challenge you to think about a more assertive role for your organisations in  the new global age.</p>
                        <p>Let me start by asking, 'Are you on the 'Knowledge Nation'  agenda? </p>
                        <p>Now don't simply tell me you're not sure what the details  are because Beazley has not allowed Barry Jones's long draft to be published as  yet. Because whatever the details, you should have already been involved and  actively lobbying to get your work on the agenda. For education, new learning,  harnessing the new technology and lifelong learning <strong>is</strong> the agenda of the future.</p>
                        <p>To be a strategic player, you have to get <strong>on</strong> the agenda, whatever it is.</p>
                        <p>First, you have to ask what is it? Is it national, state or  local? Is it economic, political, cultural, social, or purely educational? Is  it broadly or narrowly defined? Future-directed or backward-looking?</p>
                        <p>Second, you need to know whose agenda is it? Who are the key  players, the agenda-setters? Are they political parties, corporate players, or  community interest groups? Where are you in the game of agenda-setting?</p>
                        <p>And third, you need to ask, how do they get to set the  community agenda anyway - is it superior knowledge and wisdom or simply control  of the financial strings that pull? What are the avenues through which the  preferred agenda of our community is articulated? And does it take account of  the most crucial element of modern life - its pluralism, its complexity, the  competitive nature of diverse community interests and their regional,  locality-based particular needs?</p>
                        <p>If adult and further community education is seen as  peripheral to the broader community agenda, it will miss out on resources and  effectiveness, so you have to articulate your relevance to the various agendas  that circulate within society and within your particular communities. To get on  the agenda, what you have to offer must be seen as relevant, and strategic to  their goals as well as your own. You don't and can't sit alone in splendid  isolation affirming your own self-worth.</p>
                        <p>So networking is merely a start. Your 'voice' needs to be  heard in a whole range of strategic places. You have to participate actively in  a whole range of partnerships with groups whose agenda will be better served by  working together with you. Strategic partnership is the name of the game. </p>
                        <p>Let me step back for a moment to ask what the new education  is about.</p>
                        <p>In the United Kingdom  and Europe, the new education is seen as central to the  attack on social exclusion. They have stopped talking about mere poverty, or  disadvantage, about welfare programs as a safety net for those who have missed  out. Social exclusion is more than just economic disadvantage. It is the denial  of citizenship; it is isolation from the mainstream processes of society, being  excluded from those relationships that make for human and social capital. The  whole discourse has changed, whereas Australia  limps along with the old language and outmoded debates. </p>
                        <p>Social inclusion is about power and agency, about people's  capacity to control their own lives. It is about being as 'effective' as  possible, about having both a sense of competence and the capacities for  competent action in and on the world. </p>
                        <p>Social inclusion in a global age requires total reform of  the structures and processes of governance to promote 'joined-up' programs and  multi-agency working, within local communities, involving citizens in  decision-making and in the 'delivery' of services. It requires an end to the  separate silo mentality of government departments, a new language of resourcing  rather than servicing communities, and a more location-based approach to  democratic participation than we have had in the past.</p>
                        <p>The problem of citizenship in a pluralistic modern society  is in essence one of 'voice' - how to encourage competing claims for  participation within a cohesive, shared public space; not just the old  'entitlement citizenship' of 'individual rights', but encouraging a new type of  voice and agency which acknowledges the contested nature of public purposes.</p>
                        <p>The new education needed for a new age requires a broader  conception of purpose, of human capacity, of frameworks of learning and of  assessment. The new goal is one of active citizenship, not narrow vocational  training, or acquiring specific bodies of information. The goal must be to  develop not a 'Knowledge Nation', but a 'Learning Society'. </p>
                        <p>Learning has to be reconnected to living, to the practice of  dialogue and negotiation, through active community participation, the  enrichment of human potential through the arts and culture, and must involve  emotional wellbeing, not just a narrowly instrumental approach to cognitive  learning. The over-arching goal of education is to develop a sense of agency  and those capacities that make for competence in a complex modern society.  Learning must be seen as the development of the whole person. It is therefore  never finished as 'schooling' or even as 'education', because learning is a  lifelong project. We even have to learn to be old.</p>
                        <p>Such a concept of learning has many implications. I shall  mention just two in the context of this conference. </p>
                        <p>One is that learning is always cooperative, dependent on  learning relationships and shared projects; it is not just an individual and  internal process of mind. So we have to think in terms of communities of  learning, not of individual learners. It is especially important to encourage  relationships within families (the first and most crucial community of  learning) which develop in children an interest in and mutual support for  learning. We have to see parents as partners, with teachers and adult  educators, for it is only through them that children can acquire the motivation  to learn, to extend themselves, to do well in the world and make some impact in  the world.</p>
                        <p>The second implication is that we only acquire such agency  if we find our voice, as individuals and as members of groups. We must learn to  talk, and 'talk' in this context involves both listening and hearing, as well  as being able to express our beliefs, feelings and claims on life itself. Every  individual must be able to enter a conversation with others that develops  mutual understanding and reflection; we must learn to discriminate between  options and form judgements about the course to follow. We choose and decide  not just for ourself, but also with others. And we cannot 'talk' unless we can  imagine and create a possible (joint) future, which makes the arts, music,  drama and sport central to the creation of a rich language base, a foundation  for lifelong dialogue and learning interaction with other people.</p>
                        <p>To say it another way, the purpose of education is not just  to acquire information and skills, vocational or otherwise. We have to ask,  instead:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>What do people need skills for?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul type="disc">
                          <li>to       make them self-dependent and capable </li>
                          <li>to       satisfy the need for competence, a sense of efficacy</li>
                          <li>to       give them the capacity and sense of agency to participate in the decisions       that affect their lives</li>
                          <li>to       give them a 'voice', the ability to articulate who and what they       are/need/want</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                          <li>What sorts of skills are critical to life in a  global communication era?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul type="disc">
                          <li>the       capacity to locate and sort information</li>
                          <li>the       ability to apply knowledge to new problems and situations, since       complexity and change are endemic</li>
                          <li>how       to communicate, share and learn from others (cooperative competence)</li>
                          <li>self-insight       and empathy (Gardner's intra-       and inter-personal intelligences, Goleman's 'emotional intelligence')</li>
                          <li>the       ability to understand and see through politics, dogma, the media haze, so       we can make informed choices. You are not 'free' unless you can stand back       and look at things with some scepticism; you are not free to 'choose'       unless you have access to socially valued resources</li>
                          <li>you       do need skills that society values and will pay for (rapidly changing       vocational skills, communication skills, managerial skills, etc.)</li>
                          <li>life       skills for living a good life (values, inter-personal, cultural)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Where do life skills develop?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul type="disc">
                          <li>not       just in schools or colleges and training programs</li>
                          <li>not       just in adult education courses</li>
                          <li>but       in a whole range of learning communities</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If ACE's own agenda/purpose/goal is</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>to further education</li>
                          <li>to continue education</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>then it is, by definition, to encourage lifelong learning.  It is the ongoing transformation of people as skilled action learners, what  someone called 'the prevention of blindness', a search for light and discovery.  The task is to enhance and develop people, both for their own enlightenment,  and for the good of the community as a whole (hence, the 'Knowledge Nation' or  the 'Learning Society')</p>
                        <p>This in turn means that</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>you've got to look at where else learning  starts, and takes place in an ongoing way</li>
                          <li>you've got to realise that education is a  shared, partnership activity and that community-building is crucial in a  globally competitive age. ACE must be seen as a strategic player in that  process of building a learning society.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Let me list briefly some of the key learning communities  with which ACE must become a strategic partner. You need to know what are their  agendas, who sets them, and how you get yourself onto their agendas if you are  to stay relevant. You need to discuss how you can strategically ally yourself  in the sharing of learning resources across all these learning communities.</p>

                          <li>Families: </li>

                          <li>building inter-generational links within the  community, older people as resources for learning</li>
                          <li>how does ACE help inform families about the best  learning processes to motivate, stimulate children for life?</li>

                        <p>How can ACE help develop these prerequisites of  community-building? Essentially, by forming partnerships with that whole range  of learning communities and ensuring that lifelong learning is seen as a  crucial strategic partner in all their projects and concerns.</p>
                        <p>Partnerships are built upon people, and their capacity to  negotiate is essential. </p>
                        <p>ACE needs the self-confidence to articulate not just what it  has to offer, but also <u>how</u> it could work strategically with partners <u>for  mutual benefit</u>. </p>
