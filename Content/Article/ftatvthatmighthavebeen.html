have been</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>I would be foolish to attempt to say
with certainty what free-to-air television will look like five to ten years from
now but it is clearly struggling to maintain its dominance in the media
marketplace. There are enormous challenges facing broadcasting and the economic
model that has underpinned the industry is outdated. Yet, as with climate
change science, denial and inertia are still pervasive within the commercial
industry in Australia as well as the ABC.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>These symptoms have been endemic in
Australian broadcasting from the time television began in 1956, for life has
been easy and governments have been malleable, fearing the networks' power and
critique and their impact on the electorate. Commercial television has been a
money making machine and licencees have been allowed to get away with the
spoils. They have had to be forced by regulation to spend money on Australian
content and children's programs. But the rules of the game have changed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Technology has reshaped the media
landscape dramatically. Google and DVDs appeared at the end of the 90s,
Facebook 2003, YouTube 2005 and Twitter 2006. The game industry has outstripped
revenue from cinema with many players coming from television's prime audience.
But content providers remain very slow to respond to the challenges and TV
managers remain averse to taking risks and providing the investment innovation
requires, as their heads will roll if they fail.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The television industry has seen the
tsunami coming but they seem at a loss to find an appropriate and viable
response. Historically they have cried 'wolf' whenever the public has made
demands. With their cries of poverty they have undermined and modified
Australian quotas, delayed the introduction of digital television, won
concessions on advertising regulations and pleaded for cuts to their licence
fees. The latest concession by government is to halve fees to ease the financial
difficulties all three commercial networks are experiencing. Even so, as the
recent upheavals in print journalism demonstrate, no time should be lost in
identifying solutions to find the appropriate place for free-to-air in the
media marketplace as the digital revolution proceeds. There are already many
unhappy shareholders.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>It need not be this way. Television is
after all simply a delivery system, one with a wide reach which has given it a
natural advantage. But not only has the industry failed to adapt to the changes
in the technology on which the delivery system is based, it has struggled with
content innovation, failing to satisfy the demonstrated needs and interests of
its audience while it clings to old habits and structures. If free-to-air fails
it will be due to a failure of imagination and creativity for it is content
that attracts the viewers who keep the industry afloat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The old model of television broadcasting
- selling eyeballs to advertisers - has long been irrelevant. The ability to
record and view later began with the introduction of the VCR to living rooms in
the late 70's. That technology was a clear threat to the broadcasting business
model, but it took until December 2009, for the ratings collection body, OzTAM,
to begin tracking 'time-shift' audiences. Viewer demand for flexible
schedulinghas been clear for decades.Further evidence was the extent of
streaming which followed the introduction of ninemsn and Yahoo7 in 2009 which
approached five million online video streams a month, with Ten Network's <i>Masterchef
</i>generating nine million streams.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Television has clung to a model that
assumes the audience wants a scheduler to construct an evening's program
viewing for them, but station loyalty belonged to a bygone age. Stations have
tried to get around channel-switching by not sticking to advertised times and
allowing a program to go overtime so a viewer will miss the start of the next
program they want to see on an opposing channel. These techniques cause
frustration and encourage piracy which is rife.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The technique of blurring advertising
with programs, even using program actors in ads to confuse when you 'fast
forward', is intensely annoying. Once upon a time such practices were outlawed
by the regulator. Now product placement ads are integral to the program, but
these tampering techniques will not save free-to-air TV. More radical and
fundamental changes will be required.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The broadcasting regulator in Australia
was always 'reluctant' but has become more and more so. When I was appointed to
the Australian Broadcasting Control Board (ABCB) in 1975 I was shocked by the
complacency I encountered at the board table. The ABCB seemed to see their role
as serving the interests of the industry rather than the public. This attitude
set me on the path to reform of children's programming which became a 30 year
project.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Australians took to television in the
fifties so rapidly the grand promises made about serving the Australian
community with quality programming were off the agenda, forgotten as program
managers travelled to the US and UK cherry-picking the best of overseas
programming they could obtain more cheaply than producing their own. When
reform of Program Standards and Australian content requirements were mooted in
1975, by the ABCB responding to pressure from a Labor government in Canberra,
the industry claimed they couldn't afford Australian drama and children's
programming because of the high costs of the introduction of colour technology
at that time. The Fraser Government on winning the election in 1975 announced
it would abolish the troublesome ACBC, replacing it with the Australian
Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Colour proved to be a bonanza as
audience numbers soared, but that did not prevent the commercial industry from
challenging in the courts the new children's standards and quotas set by the
ABT. The networks lost that battle eventually when the Hawke government
introduced new legislation to close loopholes, but they continued to take the
path of least resistance, doing the minimum required. That conservative
approach over years has meant free-to-air networks have failed to adapt to
changing conditions and encourage a culture of creativity. Most telling in this
changed environment they have not developed relevant programs for the young
including young adults who between them are the greatest consumers of media and
the discriminating audience of the future.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The ABC has also dragged its feet. In
November 2009 Kim Dalton, Head of ABC Television and Chair of Freeview, said,
'Free-to-air Australia was experiencing an explosion in the number of
platforms, business models and technologies that could deliver TV to viewers
and they posed significant risks to free-to-air TV and Australian production.'
Yet when the ABC moved into digital television with an opportunity to break new
ground for an audience heavily engaged with new media, they chose expediency
over innovation, establishing a children's channel on a model that was more
than two decades old.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The first Children's Channel in the UK
was set up in 1984. It became digital in 1999. The BBC's two digital children's
channels were launched in 2002. A decade later the time was right for a new
model. Yet the ABC Managing Director Mark Scott on Nov 18 2010, unashamedly
argued to government, 'You've got challenges converting this country to digital
television…Let us help you do that? A great way is creating a digital
free-to-air children's television channel which will also be of educational
benefit to this country, help the independent production sector, and be a
renaissance of children's television.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>That avowed willingness to put the ABC
at the disposal of government interests rang alarm bells publicly and the
rhetoric did not match the reality of course. We got ABC3. The ABC called for
projects that were high volume, low cost and derivative of adult series, not
creative, educational or capable of leading a renaissance. The approach
typified the limited thinking, opportunism and unwillingness to innovate that
has dogged broadcasting in Australia. Networks continue to look for solutions
that have been found elsewhere in the world, but the rest of the world is now
short on solutions as well, and cable and subscription television have become
very competitive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>In order to draw audiences to their
outlets, and price free-to-air out of the market some big media players are
pumping huge investment into drama and sports in particular. Home Box Office
have demonstrated what a television renaissance really looks like with
outstanding writer-driven multiple narrative series like S<i>ix Feet Under, The
Sopranos, West Wing, The Wire, Dexter, Boardwalk Empire, Breaking Bad, Mad Men,
Sons of Anarchy, Game of Thrones, Homeland. </i>People want these programs and
will pay for them, buy box sets or pirate them to get hold of them when they
are first released. In Australia,in order to stem piracy Home Box Office series
are now being shown on Foxtel within hours of going to air in the US. 'Express
from the US' is the campaign catch cry and it's a good move. Some of these
programs are finding their way to Australian free-to air, and the ABC and
commercial networks are reminded how viewers crave excellent drama like <i>Underbelly,
Redfern</i>, or <i>The Slap </i>but the competition from alternative sources of
quality programming is now hurting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Sports is another classic example of
fierce competition with payments for rights so high it is doubtful whether
return on investment can sustain the strategy. The Olympics and the AFL
Football are cases in point. Rights are so costly sharing arrangements are
being negotiated. And there's the platform and audience functionality issue as
audiences demand more functionality, interactivity and choice. Here is where
Sport has overtaken Children's by leaps and bounds, leaving the children's
industry well in its wake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The challenge for kids programming is
one of design and architecture rather than technical functionality. The
technologies for a new service that could be a fully integrated multimedia
service are already widely available around the world. Complex websites that offer
high levels of interactivity are commonplace and many have video playing and
audio listening capability. Most broadcasters have an on-demand listening and
viewing facility now. Pod casts, social networking and games are widely
available online and a wide range of media creation and editing tools is
available free.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>For children a broadcaster should design
and build a robust, flexible, multipurpose platform that lets kids do what they
want in the ways they want, when they want, including viewing their favourite
programs on demand. At the moment most services are single purpose and assume a
user will watch a program and then when they've finished that perhaps play a
game which may relate to the program theme, then chat with a friend and so on.
In today's world kids are very comfortable doing several things at the same
time, keeping a number of windows open on their desktops so they can flip
between them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>From a production point of view the
challenge is to engage the right teams of people to conceptualise, design and
run such a service. When groups from different cultures come together they tend
to battle for power. If television people dominate such a new service the
evidence so far suggests they will build an online TV delivery mechanism with a
bit of interactivity on the side. If online people dominate they'll probably go
for technical functionality over narrative and usefulness. . These are quite
significant challenges but this is what the audience now wants. But if people
who run the new service are in it for the money and simply want to exploit kids
as a market then we needn't bother. And that takes us to the role children
themselves might play in the design of a new service.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The phenomenon of YouTube, reputedly
created (2005) by two friends who were having difficulty sharing a homemade
video, demonstrates in startling terms how much material is 'out there' and how
much people , particularly young people are interested in engaging in small
production. A year after start-up, 65,000 videos were being uploaded every day
and the site was receiving 100 million video views per day. Google saw the
potential and that year bought YouTube for US$1.65 billion. Kids love YouTube.
School yard word of mouth and texting mean they can promote their own little
films and share very funny experiences widely with their friends. Trawling
YouTube is a lot more fun than watching the umpteenth repeat of children's
channel programs. This is not to say children, like adults, don't still respond
well to first class narratives in live action and animation but such programs
are all too rare as networks try to fill the hours on the voracious television
beast with repeat programs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The model for adults will not be very
different from that described for children as time goes on, for ten years from
now the young people clamoring for these services today will be the prime time
audience of tomorrow. They will be getting their news from a variety of sources
and although news programs are still the ratings winners for the networks they
cannot remain the same with a 24/7 news cycle and online news services, not to
mention citizen journalists on social media. Networks are searching for the
next reality TV coup or the fashion that will follow the flood of cooking shows
to save their bacon. These programs represent the fine weather before the next
violent storm that leads managers to believe it will all be okay. Viewers will
still watch: perhaps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>I think imagination, enterprise and the
brains of some very smart people are required. This is a most important issue
for our times and our way of life. If free-to-air cannot afford to provide the
services required maybe competitors will have to partner up. Maybe free-to-air
will become one element in a wider offer - a loss leader – with content
providers generating their profits downstream along the chain. This is
happening to a degree with some drama production. In 1994, despite my best
lobbying efforts at the time, the Film Finance Corporation allowed pre-sales of
a series to both a commercial network, which paid a reduced price for a first
run to meet quota requirements, and to the ABC which bought subsequent runs.
This also happens with cinema films where, although rights can be purchased
prior to production, subsequent television screenings, cable and DVD sales are
deferred until box office revenue is exhausted. This orderly structure doesn't
work when copies of a film are pirated and placed on the internet within hours
of release.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>It's all about reach and share still,
because they're the metrics the industry is addicted to and TV is still the
most effective medium to deliver both –although struggling massively and
attempting to second guess audiences. Public broadcasting can only prop up
free-to-air so long as Governments are willing to provide funds and this is
under threat around the world. Even the iconic BBC is having problems and
worrying about the next decision on its license fee in 2016. During his
election campaign Governor Mitt Romney made clear he would cut funding to
public broadcasting (PBS) in the US. In Australia a merger of ABC and SBS has
been canvassed and Liberal Governments in the past have generally been less
sympathetic to public broadcasting. Tony Abbott and his Treasurer are heralding
budget cuts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Ironically one of the most productive
partnerships in this challenging context could be between education and
television. Education has always taken a hiding from free-to-air television
management who feared such a label would turn an audience off. The ABC
abandoned its educational children's television department, school's programs
were heavily reduced and children's producers generally eschewed 'education' to
isolate their entertainment programs so no child would think they were an
extension of school. Now with convergence, search and interactivity, education
and entertainment have come together and kids have no issues moving easily
between the two domains on the same technology. As a result teaching and
learning are being transformed with kids enjoying taking the initiative in
their learning. Universities are also undergoing cultural change as they
wrestle with the implications of online learning. Hundreds of thousands of
people are downloading lectures and materials to study voluntarily even when a
course is not credited towards a degree. There are opportunities here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>A child born today in Australia will
likely live to be one hundred years old and lifelong learning must become a
social objective. There is massive potential for television to serve that need.
Brian Cox, the famous physicist/presenter got huge audiences in the UK with his
series <i>The Wonders of the Solar System</i>, when the BBC scheduled it in
prime time. He is credited with changing the perception of maths and science
subjects in schools with entries in A Levels up forty percent over five years.
It's been dubbed 'the Brian Cox effect'. Imaginative educational television can
achieve what governments and educators fail to achieve on their own.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>We are now well informed about the
importance of learning in the early years. There should be a partnership
between government, pre-schools, schools and the media to develop an early
childhood program designed around the goals of the Early Childhood National
Curriculum Framework which would be the core of a community based early
childhood project. Children come to media willingly yet we do not think to use
technologies to develop and teach children; we use them to market to them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The solutions to television's
predicament may well lie in its origins. When the Government introduced
television to Australia, when licences were granted and promises made, we set
out down the roles and the obligations of broadcasting. The medium was intended
to inform and entertain and benefit society. In a world that might have been,
those administering broadcasting should have been held to account to follow the
promises made, rather than pursuing short term interests and the bottom line.
For broadcasting is not just another business. It is an integral component in
our education and democratic political system. But a visionary idea does not
play out in a world where marketers, like election campaign managers, narrow
their audiences into demographics and special interest groups. So doing, they
lead us into intellectual cul-de-sacs and inevitably they will lead the
industry into economic oblivion.</span></p>
