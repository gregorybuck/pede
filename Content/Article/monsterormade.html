<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>What makes a
young killer tick and what can we do to prevent such violence, asks Patricia
Edgar.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>ON MAY 1, 1992,
an event took place in the US that would rock the country and grab headlines
around the world. A former high school student gunned down four people and
wounded nine others. There had been mass killings before but this massacre,
which was carried out by a former student at his alma mater against fellow
students and teachers, was to set off a spate of school shootings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Over the next
decade, there were 24 shooting rampages in schools across 15 states carried out
by youths aged from 13 to 18. Most of these shooters were not alienated
misfits; they were from stable homes. So what makes a young person turn to such
extreme violence? What changed in the '90s? This is the subject of the recently
released film <i>We Need to Talk about Kevin</i>, based on Lionel Shriver's
2003 book of the same name. Fascinating though they are, the novel and the film
add little to our understanding of why young people kill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Shriver chose to
tell the story from the mother's perspective so her novel becomes an
examination of the mother's guilt. The book raises frightening questions about
nature versus nurture. Either way, the mother ends up feeling responsible for
giving birth to a monster.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>At the end of
the novel and the film, Kevin's tormented mother asks her son, when she is
visiting him on his 18th birthday two years after his incarceration: ''Please,
look me in the eye. You killed 11 people .. Look me in the eye and tell me
why.'' Kevin responds glumly: ''I used to think I knew, now I am not so sure.''</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>In his book <i>Why
Kids Kill</i>, Peter Langman, the clinical director of KidsPeace, an
organisation that helps adolescents in crisis, synthesises the voluminous
documentation available on 10 shooters to try to find ways to identify
potential young killers before they act.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Langman found
these were not ordinary kids who were bullied into retaliation, played too many
video games or simply wanted to be famous. The media image of shooters as
alienated students who had no involvement with their schools was wrong.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>However, a clear
connection could be made with depression. Of the 10 shooters in the book, nine
suffered from depression and suicidal thoughts. Langman says that despite the
shooters' apparent normalcy, they were seriously disturbed children, but the
complex combinations of environmental, family and individual factors varied
from one perpetrator to the other. ''Common factors included homicidal rage,
suicidal anguish, inadequate identities seeking to establish an image of
manliness through violence, envy towards those with higher status, a desire for
fame, fragile personalities that were highly reactive to commonplace slights
and frustrations, and masochistic tendencies to hold grudges and magnify wrongs
suffered,'' he writes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>In all cases,
there were failures of empathy. The shooters' worlds shrank into the needs of
the self: their friends did not matter; their parents did not matter; their own
deaths did not matter. The modern world's obsession with self, with rights,
with the pursuit of happiness and success comes into focus at the very point of
transition from youth to manhood. Is this why these mass shootings became a
phenomenon in the '90s? For this was when a culture of narcissism, celebrity and
self-aggrandisement took hold and the idea of responsibility was undermined.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Is this social
change a clue to understanding what has shaped these young males who were
already depressed and disturbed? Given the complexity of the motivations of
each it is daunting to work out what we can do. But individually and as a
community, we must try to identify these troubled children and restore balance
before they kill others or turn on themselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Australia has
not had school shootings; perhaps the inaccessibility of guns has helped, but
depression is common and suicide is the second main cause of death in Australia
among 14 to 19-year-old males after car accidents.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Greater
vigilance and care can make a difference. Langman claims there have been many
foiled school attacks and potential shooters have been helped when identified
early. Students in the US are now more likely to report any concerns. Schools
are trying to reduce student conflict and harassment and are taking steps to
ensure every student is connected with at least one adult.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Talking openly
and regularly with their children and their school can help parents respond
promptly. Knowing their children's friends, where they go, what they do, what
websites they visit, may help. And we need to convey to young people that the
self is not all, that others matter, and empathy is a core skill they need to
nurture as they grow up. Langman warns if the school your child attends is
concerned about your child, pay attention.</span></p>
