<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%'>Don Edgar</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%'>Should Sesame
Street's Bert and Ernie be allowed to marry, as a same-sex couple setting new
norms for the world of children's TV? Prime Minister Julia Gillard would
probably not agree. Gillard insists that her 'conservative upbringing' will not
allow her to accept marriage as anything other than the union of a man and a
woman. Presumably her conservative upbringing was put on hold when she decided
to 'live in sin' with her male partner Tim Mathieson. She cites no religious
reason for opposing gay marriage, being a professed atheist, merely the
conventional past. She seems not to understand that marriage under the Act is
already a 'civil union', not a fixed moral law or a religious sacrament to be
preserved at all costs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%'>The looming Labor
Conference debate on gay marriage will be a defining moment not just for the
Labor Party but for the whole of Australian society. Already several States
recognize what they call 'civil unions' which give same-sex partners equal
rights to medical decisions if one is ill, to state superannuation and property
distribution rights if they split up. The Marriage Act is under the purview of
the Commonwealth, not the States and Prime Minister Julia Gillard is being
called upon to allow a conscience vote in Parliament to test the waters. That
is what should happen. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%'>Marriage has a
long and varied history, of which opponents of gay marriage seem to be
ignorant.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%'>With very few
exceptions, marriage has been monogamous, secular and personal. It was an
arrangement between two families (the two individuals had varying say) for the
purposes of regulating the natural sexual instincts of young people, consolidating
and managing family property, ensuring procreation and the passing on of a
legitimate family name, and protecting the rights of both partners (though more
the male's than the female's) and the rights of children born or raised within
the marriage. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%'>Gay marriage
threatens none of these traditional goals. Indeed it may make for greater social
stability and certainly ensure the equal rights of all partners who agree to
accept marriage's legal obligations and responsibilities. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%'>In early Greek and
Roman times marriage was virtually compulsory, the single man being ridiculed
and denied important public roles. Even the Spartans who openly practised
homosexuality had to marry and have children. It was good for society. As
Demosthenes put it, "We have prostitutes for our pleasure, concubines for our
health and wives to bear us lawful offspring." The word 'lawful' is the key
word here. It was St Paul who wrote, "Better to marry than to burn." (1
Corinthians 7:9) Nowadays you don't have to. But marriage still serves
important legal and social purposes. Islam enjoins its adherents to marry 'for
the greater community'.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%'>Early Christianity
accepted Roman law, with marriage seen as a civil and private arrangement, but
stopped penalizing singles because celibacy came to be seen as a desirable
state. It stopped the barbaric northern European practice of 'sale marriage'
(which gave us the wedding ring as a down payment on the full 'bride price'
paid on delivery) and thus improved the status of women and gradually civilized
marriage customs. Indeed in Europe, even after the Catholic Church declared
marriage was a 'sacrament', it was still seen to spring from the free consent
of two partners.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%'>Most marriages throughout
history were not religious, but what we call common law marriages - some
consensual, recognized simply by living together for one year, others marked by
a commitment ceremony with witnesses. Up to the tenth century, most such
ceremonies took place outside the church door and it was not until the
thirteenth century that the priest took charge. It was a practical, economic
affair, a union of convenience which improved the capacity of an individual man
or woman to survive and thrive and joined two families in mutually advantageous
kinship. To say that marriage was not yet a 'romantic' matter of love and
personal choice (given arranged marriages and patriarchal control) ignores both
the sexual urges of youth and the reality that even intimacy after rather than
before marriage can lead to love.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%'>But the 16<sup>th</sup>
century Protestant Reformation set the cat amongst the pigeons. Luther declared
marriage 'a worldly thing' that belonged to the realm of government. Calvin
agreed. So the Catholic Church's  response at the 1563 Council of Trent was to
denounce all common law marriages, insist on having unions ratified by a priest
and two witnesses. It imposed complex impediments to marriage (through the
'banns') such as blood relations to the seventh degree, family affinity and
godparent relationships and, most significantly, it abolished divorce. The
Catechism of 1566 spelt out the definition of marriage as a union between a man
and a woman (i.e. heterosexuals only) and indissolubility for life, 'until
Death do us part'. This is the bottom line for those who oppose homosexual
marriage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%'>The Church hung on
for centuries, losing the battle against secularism and the power of the State,
but not against a broad acceptance of that basic definition. The French
Revolution made civil marriage compulsory, regardless of whether a church
service was held; Bismarck imposed State control over the institution of
marriage in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, returning marriage to its traditional
status as a legally binding economic and social contract between two consenting
adults. This was an important step in the bureaucratic rationalizing of modern
society. The poet John Milton was a bit ahead of his time, arguing that divorce
was a must when mutual love was lacking and marriage had become a sham. But it
is that sentiment that informed the new no-fault divorce laws of the twentieth
century, based on the breakdown of an agreement between two equal partners. It
is the quality of the relationship that matters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%'>This left the
protection of partners' and children's civil rights as the main reason for
having a legally recognized marriage of any kind. Today, sex is easy to have
outside marriage, and long-term sexual partnerships take the place of formal
marriage for many. In countries with an over-population of youth, such as China
(with over 18 million more young men than women) social instability threatens
with bride kidnapping and hormonally riotous (and often unemployed) youth
having no ready outlet. They may have to encourage homosexual relationships!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%'>The problem then
is no longer the regulation of sexual behavior, but the legal rights and
responsibilities of the partners and the care of children. The economic value
of mutual care and financial support through marriage is clear from the growing
cost of welfare support for single mothers and research clearly supports the
view that two parents are better than one in the raising of children. A violent
or unhappy marriage is not good for children, but divorce also often involves
ongoing conflict, unstable housing and schooling, poverty and disadvantage. Australia's
marriage rate has declined by a quarter since the 1980s. We should be
encouraging and supporting marital stability, regardless of the sex of the
parents.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%'>Marriages are no
longer arranged, between families; mutual consent is all that's required. If
gay couples want to marry and declare a lifelong commitment, to make their love
and mutual support public, what harm can there be in that? Far better to have a
publicly declared commitment than an unstable sexual relationship lacking any
legally binding and reciprocal responsibilities and social obligations. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%'>In Australia, we
have already recognized that 'de facto' couples are virtually the same as
legally married couples: they have equal rights to shared property, finances,
superannuation. Their children (whether natural, step or adopted) have rights
of care from both de facto parents in the same way as do children of married
parents, and those parents have a shared responsibility to care for them after
separation. It is ironic that the law recognizes this more unstable form of
relationship but denies recognition to same-sex couples who want to take on the
legal obligations of formal marriage. Significantly, in recognizing the social
reality of couples 'living together', the law insists on their responsibility
to children and on the economic equality of the partners.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%'>There is no reason
why this should not hold with homosexual couples, but the law currently does
not recognize the rights of gay partners, or the rights of children, who may be
born of one natural partner, with a donor parent, or even a surrogate parent,
in the same way as married couples can become parents through adoption,
surrogacy or in vitro fertilization. Case after case can be found of lesbian
couples agreeing to one partner conceiving, having a child, then breaking up
and the 'birth mother' denying the other 'parent' access to their mutually
agreed-upon child. Neither married nor de facto couples can get away with that.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%'>Being a parent is
not just a biological fact; it is a social status which carries
responsibilities to the child. There have been traditional societies where several
'visiting uncles' have sex with a woman who conceives; then one visiting male
is nominated as the social 'father', regardless of whether genetics would prove
him to be the biological sire, and he carries that responsibility to help raise
the child for the rest of its life. That form of social parenting is, in our
society, made 'legal' parenting where a child is adopted or artificially
engendered, and any child whose family is so dysfunctional they cannot act as
responsible parents is made a ward of the State as the 'legal parent'. While we
might argue that no adult has the 'right' to become a parent (a notion that
leads to anguish when they cannot conceive), every child born through whatever
technique, has the 'right' to have two parents - we designate two parents as
responsible for each child's upbringing. That is why it is of more import to
resist single-motherhood, or single-person adoption than it is to resist
homosexual adoption, same-sex marriage or mutually-agreed conception.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%'>So the remaining
objection to same-sex marriage is religious and moral.  Given that church and
state are supposedly separate in a secular democracy, to continue insisting on
a religiously-derived definition of marriage is an historical anomaly.  The law
long ago took control of the marriage contract away from the Church, but it
left intact the notion that only a man and a woman could legally be married. Legislation
should keep up with changing social norms. In Australia, we have legislation
preventing discrimination on grounds of sexuality, yet this is a clear case of
sexual discrimination. Social norms round sexuality are much more fluid and
despite some continuing homophobia there is widespread acceptance that sexual
preference is no-one else's business. Well over half the population supports
same-sex marriage; three-quarters believe it will eventually become a reality. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%'>Australia is out
of step with most of the Western world. Countries such as Sweden and Norway
have long recognized same-sex marriages. The British Civil Rights Partnership
Act covers virtually all the rights of marriage. Several US states have
legislated for marital equality, the federal government under Bush moving
rapidly in its 1996 Federal Defense of Marriage Act to deny federal recognition
of those State laws. No US State has to recognize same-sex marriages ratified
in other States, but the new Act did not forbid States to allow gay marriage. Same-sex
marriage is still discriminated against through taxation and social security,
so equality has not been achieved. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%'>Similarly in Australia,
the Howard Government moved to consolidate the 'man/woman/for life' definition
of marriage, despite the fact that, for 100 years after federation in
Australia, marriage had remained undefined. As Justice Alisdair Nicholson
pointed out, even the Family Law Act (S43) injunction for the Court to have
regard to 'the need to preserve and protect the institution of marriage as the
union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others voluntarily entered
into for life' was not really a definition at all. It harks back, he says, to
Lord Penzance's 1866 definition which even then flew in the face of the 1857
provision legalizing divorce. Nicholson is unequivocal in stating that
discrimination against same-sex marriage is in contravention to the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provisions relating to
non-discrimination and to arbitrary interference in privacy and the family. And
the High Court of Australia in 1996 observed that the concept of marriage was
never frozen in time. Nor, it must be noted, was the acceptability of
homosexuality, even within the confines of religion. Social practices and norms
change and, in time, the laws must recognize that change.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%'>Finally, it must
be noted that in those countries that have already recognized gay marriage, the
evidence is clear: it does not undermine social morality or lead to undesirable
effects. On the contrary, in Sweden, heterosexual marriage rates have increased
30 per cent; similarly in Denmark, with the added result of lower divorce rates
and fewer children born out of wedlock, both surely desirable outcomes. Canada
reports a lower divorce rate for same-sex couples and the American Academy of
Pediatrics reports that children with gay parents fare as well as those with
heterosexual parents on all measures of emotional, social, cognitive, and
sexual functioning. Studies repeatedly find that marriage benefits the health
and wellbeing of the partners too. It is (as with single-parent, step, de facto
and married couple families) the nature of the relationships within that family
that matter, not its formal 'structure' or type. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%'>The Churches (and
Australia's Labor Government) have to accept that marriage serves secular
needs, not spiritual goals. Marriage is a fundamental social institution which recognizes
and regulates adult couple relationships. In the Canadian debate about same-sex
marriage, Ottowa Justice Laforme held that a 'civil union' is still an 'alternative'
status, equivalent to the segregation of black and white students in pre-Brown
vs. Board of Education US civil rights times. The State already controls the
institution of marriage as a secular institution; it is the State's
responsibility to guarantee the rights and responsibilities of all adult partners
and of children born from or being cared for within that partnership. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%'>As a matter of
individual choice, couples with religious beliefs can already opt for a church
marriage (the church being registered by the State to certify legal marriage),
though over 60 per cent today choose a non-church ceremony using a registered
civil celebrant. The Church could still insist on not conducting or recognizing
any same-sex marriage (being immune from anti-discrimination laws) but that
would be irrelevant to same-sex couples who simply want full legal recognition
of their commitment to one another. Where the State must continue to be
vigilant is in the area of mutual care and responsibility for children who may
become part of that same-sex marriage (by whatever path), and in ensuring that
gay partners have the same financial and legal rights as those already granted
to both heterosexual and de facto couples.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:115%'>Legal recognition
is not the same as moral approval and same-sex couples have done no harm, so we
should get over whatever ingrained repugnance some may feel towards
homosexuality and allow those who want to live within the legal restrictions
and obligations of formal marriage do so. The current law is out of step with
changing social norms which, history shows, are never immutable as human
relationships adapt to new circumstances. Indeed, recognizing same-sex
marriages as equal in the law to heterosexual marriages  may reinforce the ongoing
historical reality that marriage is 'an honorable estate' which 'should not be
entered into lightly'.</span></p>
