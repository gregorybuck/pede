            Children's television
            content quotas should be scrapped and the ABC should junk one of its two
            children's channels because the system for guaranteeing quality children's
            television no longer works, the architect of the original children's C
            classification says.

            Instead, a new independent online service,
            funded by an annual levy on networks should replace the current system, says
            Patricia Edgar, the founding director of the Australian Children's Television
            Foundation.

            "Get rid of all the children's quotas.
            The networks have never played the game fair and never really worked to ensure
            that the programs that they are doing are the programs that were really were
            intended by the standards," says Edgar, who as chair of the Australian
            Broadcasting Control Board's advisory committee on program standards was the
            architect of the C classification.

            weight. She was also chair of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's children's

            Television Standards.

            Systematically they have undermined the objectives of children's programming.

            Such a platform would operate like the
            ABC's iView player, allowing children to select content they wanted to watch,
            much as they do on YouTube, but without the need to produce volumes of episodes
            to sustain television timeslots or channels.

            "I am making an argument about quality
            and an argument about the audience (that) is diminishing worldwide if you look
            at the research," Edgar said. "What it shows quite clearly is the kids in the
            age group (9 to 15) are moving away from television because they are on their
            tablets and mobile phones and social media."

            Edgar's views, made in a submission to
            the government's Australian and Children's Screen Content Review that is
            examining the future of children's TV quotas, will cause angst in the
            independent production section, which has attacked ABC managing director
            Michelle Guthrie's insistence that the ABC should not be subject to such
            quotas, and fears the government will scrap such quotas, which the commercial
            free-to-air networks say they can no longer afford.

            Commercial free-to-air broadcasters
            must screen at least 96 hours of first-release Australian C drama over a

            at least 130 hours of P programs (for preschool children) per year from any

            review is about an assumption that we should sustain this industry. It's not

            same. They want something new and innovative. There are two-year-olds picking

            Former ABC director of television Kim
            Dalton recently attacked the ABC for empire building at the expense of content
            funding. "He is claiming that ABC3 was a nirvana for children's programs,"
            Edgar said. "I am saying that they were putting in low- cost studio-based cheap
