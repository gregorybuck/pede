<p><strong>A  better measure of society's wellbeing</strong></p>

<p><strong>W</strong>E  SEEM to have lost our sense of the common good, a belief in shared destiny,  despite signs that economically, environmentally and socially our lives are  increasingly interdependent. So the ridicule Leon Gettler heaps on attempts by  French President Nicolas Sarkozy and others to measure progress in terms of our  ''happiness'' (Opinion, 28/9) is unfair and unfortunate.<br />
  Gross domestic product has failed as  an indicator of either national progress or individual happiness. Yes, it is  difficult to measure happiness, and no, we don't have to be happy all of the  time. Americans' manic ''pursuit of happiness'' is the root cause of much  angst, therapeutic exploitation and misguided policymaking. Happiness is in the  main an individual experience and it is hard to imagine how one nation can be  ''happier'' than another.</p>
    <p>But what is the point of having a  measure of national progress, GDP, which is based on a paradigm that stupidly  insists more is better? GDP goes up with increased spending on crime, natural  disasters and tobacco, and does not count in the equation activities that  destroy natural resources and the quality of life. GDP supposedly measures  national income on goods and services, but excludes the cost benefits of caring  for the aged, voluntary work and the value of housework and child care, all  worth billions to the national economy and the nation's wellbeing.<br />
  What the Global Project on Measuring  the Progress of Societies (launched by Sarkozy and leading global thinkers in  2004) did was to challenge this nonsensical picture of a nation's wellbeing and  assert that, sometimes, less is better, such as less sickness, inequality,  crime, and environmental damage. Amartya Sen, Joseph Stiglitz and James Heckman  are not naively pursuing happiness; they are saying enough is enough, and the  current global economic crisis which has brought us to the brink of disaster  has proven their point.<br />
  The project's real point is the lack  of shared wellbeing - one person's happiness is another's misery (as in the  rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer, or global polluters' profits  drowning nations such as the Maldives). Wellbeing, the quality of life enjoyed  by different people, can be measured in less subjective ways. We are now told  the global economy is recovering. So why don't a lot of us feel our lives are  better? Because conventional economists and GDP track only the supposed  benefits of economic growth, not the costs, such as increasing family stress,  environmental degradation and civic disengagement.</p>
    <p>The Canadian Institute of Wellbeing  has started publishing reports on a new form of GDP, a new approach to  measuring social progress. Australia's Treasury is also ahead of the game and  is planning an Australian index of wellbeing modelled on the Canadian work.  France, South Africa, Korea and Hungary are active too, some with more urgency  than others.<br />
  The Canadian wellbeing index  measures objectively changes over time in a nation's standards of living,  including the way we use our time and balance work-family responsibilities. It also  includes more subjective measures of civic participation and community  vitality, the social capital that binds a nation together under the principle  of a shared destiny.<br />
  Canada's first reports demonstrate  what we should already know, but do not acknowledge in our national accounts:  that higher incomes have been gained (for some families) through working longer  hours and suffering higher stress; that some families with children are living  longer in unemployment and with a narrowing welfare net; that improved  education and higher incomes are associated with better health and greater  longevity; that a nation's wellbeing reflects the combination of good living  standards, healthy populations and community vitality.<br />
  In particular, we need to sound the  alarm for our children, who are the real victims of a system hell-bent on  profit before public benefit - economic growth without an improvement in public  wellbeing.</p>
    <p>Other correspondents on this page -  Ken Davidson on the coal industry's carbon trading boondoggle, Lindy Edwards on  a shrinking safety net for the jobless and Ross Gittens on the hidden costs of  population growth (Opinion, 28/9) - show a greater awareness that perhaps those  pursuing a more sensible measure of progress are on to something that will help  guide future policies better than GDP.</p>
    <p>Australia would do well to pursue  the Canadian measures of progress rather than the damaging growth model that  informs most economic modelling and government spin on how well we are doing.</p>
