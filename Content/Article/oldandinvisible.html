commonly as a pejorative term. &quot;You silly old bugger,&quot; was Bob
Hawke's riposte to a 74-year-old man who challenged him on the campaign trail
in Whyalla in 1989. When I had a hearing test recently I was told by the
audiologist that my hearing was diminished, consistent with ageing.
&quot;That's what happens when you are old,&quot; she added, as if describing a
condition akin to a disease.</span></p>

"Times New Roman","serif";color:#333333'>Ageing can be a humbling experience
for those fortunate enough to have survived the accidents and exigencies that
befall us in life. We complain about its physical effects but most of us agree
it's better than the alternative. In fact, increasing numbers of elders are
enjoying their later years in ways that defy the stereotypes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.5pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:10.5pt;
margin-left:0cm;line-height:16.5pt'><span style='font-size:14.5pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman","serif";color:#333333'>We who are old do not see ourselves as
society defines us. For many, ageing is a liberating experience; we are
consoled for any losses by a new sense of freedom and confidence. We don't fear
the future and we don't worry so much about the opinions of others. But
persistent assumptions about our incapacity undermine our well-being. The first
time I encountered ageism I was 32 years old, setting up a research study in
Darwin on the introduction of television to that city. I was working alone and
ventured into a cafe, where I got into a conversation with a group of young
people who were, I guessed, in their late teens and early 20s. The next day I
returned to the cafe to be greeted by one of the same young men, who called
out, &quot;Here's the old bird from the south.&quot;</span></p>

discrimination but men are not spared ageist stereotyping. When my husband,
Don, was taken to hospital after smashing his foot in an accident, he overheard
a nurse comment: &quot;We've got an old one out there.&quot; Don was 44 at the
time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.5pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:10.5pt;
margin-left:0cm;line-height:16.5pt'><span style='font-size:14.5pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman","serif";color:#333333'>My doctor, a woman of 65, was enquiring
about how I spend my time and we exchanged details of our interests. She said,
&quot;I like to sit and watch people in cafes. My daughter says to stop
staring, it's embarrassing. But I tell her not to worry - people don't notice
me staring; I'm invisible.&quot; And she is right. To those younger, we are a
separate form of life. People generally do not look at old people. Simone de
Beauvoir, in The Coming of Age, quotes Lucius Caecilius, a banker who lived in
Pompeii: &quot;What I find most lamentable about old age,&quot; he said,
&quot;is that one feels that now one is repulsive to the young.&quot;</span></p>

"Times New Roman","serif";color:#333333'>It seems not a lot has changed in our
perception of old age. Yet much has changed in the way we age and in our life
expectancy. We can't define with any clarity who we regard as old anymore. I
feel surprise to read, &quot;An elderly man was hit by a car,&quot; only to
discover he was 60 years old and may well have 30 years ahead of him. If the
label &quot;old&quot; is applied to someone in her 60s as well as to a
centenarian, then &quot;old age&quot; is the longest stage of life.</span></p>

margin-left:0cm;line-height:16.5pt'><span style='font-size:14.5pt;font-family:
"Times New Roman","serif";color:#333333'>So, when is someone old? Is 50 the
magic number? Is 70 the new 60? Are we old when we qualify for a Seniors Card?
When we retire from the workforce? When we qualify for the pension? When we get
sick? When we have grandchildren? When we get grey hair? When we access our
superannuation? These points are arbitrary but all describe a boundary from
which there is no return. Once we are defined as &quot;old&quot; we are
assigned to a category. We are often patronised, ignored, shouted at, called
love, dear and darling and expected to dwell on the margins of society.</span></p>

Yorker, recently described an incident when, after exiting a museum cafeteria,
he stopped to admire a Moore carving from his wheelchair. He was approached by
a guard, who bent over to address him. &quot;The guard wagged a finger in my
face, smiled a grotesque smile, raised his voice and asked, 'Did we have a nice
din-din?'?&quot; You can hear the condescension; visit any nursing home and you
will hear the same tone. Old age does not conjure up images of vital, active,
interesting people; we think instead of people who are in need of care,
physically disabled, and losing control of their bodily functions. To live
these years well, we need to be respected as individuals, have the ability to
reinvent ourselves, our work and purpose and to have access to good medical
advice.</span></p>

told by my doctor I would no longer be reminded officially to have a two-yearly
pap smear, my eyebrows went up. &quot;It's OK,&quot; said the GP. &quot;You can
still come in if you wish - we just won't be notifying you anymore that a smear
is due.&quot; Soon after, I went to see my gastroenterologist to arrange for a
five-yearly colonoscopy. The procedure was completed, there were no problems
and, as I was leaving, my doctor said, &quot;You don't need to come back
again.&quot; &quot;You mean ever?&quot; I enquired. &quot;Yes,&quot; he
replied. &quot;But my father had bowel cancer in his mid-70s, that's why I come
in for regular check-ups,&quot; I countered. &quot;OK,&quot; he said, &quot;you
can come back.&quot;</span></p>

mammogram, and my consulting specialist of 20 years' standing said,
&quot;You're cancer-free after all this time, so you don't need to come back
again.&quot; Having served 10 years as chair of the Breast Cancer Network of
Australia, I am familiar with the statistics. I know that a woman's risk of
breast cancer increases with age, and that if you have had breast cancer before
- as I had 25 years ago - your risk is higher. My physician knew better than I
that mutations in cancer genes accumulate with ageing, so I pressed him to
explain. It turned out that he was retiring in a year's time. &quot;What are
you doing with all your records?&quot; I asked. &quot;I haven't thought about
that,&quot; he replied. &quot;I'll probably put them under the house.&quot;
&quot;What about giving them to your patients?&quot; I suggested. &quot;I'll
think about that,&quot; was the response.</span></p>

indicated that my experience of turning 70 was not unique. Several friends had
been given the same message by their doctors - enough for me to conclude that
the medical system wants to cull those over 70 from the groups receiving
regular &quot;expensive&quot; procedures because the expenditure is no longer
considered cost-effective.</span></p>

"Times New Roman","serif";color:#333333'>I put this to my GP, who explained
tactfully that life-expectancy statistics cut in about the time it would take a
new cancer to develop. So if a person is cancer-free at 70 they will likely
live to 78 or 82 (the current life-expectancy targets) if they get a new
cancer. And as cancer is a disease of old age, many will certainly contract it.
My GP effectively confirmed that we are deemed by the medical profession,
unofficially at least, to have lived our expected life span, and if cancer or
anything else catches up with us, that's too bad. Yet an increasing number of
70-year-olds remain active, defying current medical assumptions.</span></p>

I act as a mentor to a number of people and get called on for advice; I travel
widely, enjoy new experiences, organise two homes, engage with the community
and take an interest in politics. I enjoy the new freedom from past
responsibilities, and the ability to decide what I will do and when I will do
it. I enjoy my life with my husband of 54 years. I don't cause trouble and I

have arthritis and a successful hip replacement. Society may wish to define me
as past my prime but I can see plenty of life to be lived yet. My lifelong
friends are just as active and some are still working full-time at 75. Yet,
just at the time we can expand our horizons, insurance companies raise the cost
of travel insurance and disallow multiple-trip policies in a 12-month period to
people over the age of 75 on the grounds that they are too great a health risk.
Beyond 80, travel insurance coverage is almost impossible to acquire, no matter
how healthy you may be.</span></p>

"Times New Roman","serif";color:#333333'>The myth that health costs and aged
care will be the straws that break our system's back derives from simplistic
analysis. The longer we work, the more these costs will be relieved. Experts
who look beyond the bottom line to examine the system point out there are many
ways it can become more cost-effective. Medical policy designed to marginalise
the &quot;old&quot; at 70 is not one of them. Since our life span will continue
to increase, it would make sense to continue to narrow the gap between health,
ill health, decline and death and increase quality of life as long as possible.
Disease prevention in the final decades of life would be a sounder policy than
risking the cost of lengthy morbidity through turning a medical blind eye.</span></p>
