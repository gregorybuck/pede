    <p>In  a global information age, life-long learning will be central to our economic  survival and to our social wellbeing. All the more important then, to examine  closely the foundations of learning, those core competencies and attitudes laid  down in the pre-school and primary school years of schooling.</p>
    <p><strong>The forgotten  foundations of learning</strong></p>
    <p>It  seems many of us (including education theorists and teachers themselves as well  as politicians and administrators) have forgotten the value of primary schools  in this life-long learning continuum. We have fallen into the trap of current  economic dogma, which focuses on short-term outputs in dollar value terms  instead of longer-term outcomes and the high cost of neglecting them. Science and  technology are the skills most valued; vocational training for specific jobs is  given more priority than broadly vocational education and the capacity for  self-directed learning; the acquisition of specialist bodies of information  takes priority over problem-solving, imaginative application of what has been  learned and the transferability of skills; interpersonal competencies and  social outcomes are seen as soft and unquantifiable, hence unworthy of  curriculum attention or adequate funding.</p>
    <p>Such  distorted views about the value of education are reflected in the current  funding differentials between primary and secondary schools across Australia.<br />
        The  recent analysis of 'Resourcing of Australian State Primary Schools' by Les  Bishop, for the Forum of Australian State primary Principals (FASPP) (November,  1999) gives a factual picture of relative poverty. </p>
    <p>Commonwealth  funding under the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Assistance) clearly  favors secondary schools. In 1999, the General Recurrent Grants were made on  the basis of $397 for each primary student and $585 for each secondary student.  Other block grants are distributed by the States at the same ratio for primary  and secondary schools. With some variations by state and territory, secondary  school students in government schools attract between 22% and 53% more funds  than primary school students, and the national average differential is 38%.  Only the DETYA guidelines for Literacy funding focus on the early years of  schooling, and they represent only 8 per cent of total Commonwealth funding to  the States. </p>
    <p>As  well, secondary schools are staffed more favorably than primary schools,  attracting an average 38% more teachers per student than the same number of  primary students. The proportion of senior staff positions is higher for  secondary schools and the average FTE Ratios are 17.6 for primary schools,  compared with 12.7 for secondary. Secondary schools are also staffed more  favorably with non-teaching staff than primary schools, especially with  administrative and clerical staff.</p>
    <p>Even  more disturbing is the absence of any stated educational rationale for this  bias in funding. Commonwealth financial assistance to government schools in  1997 added up to a total of $1.471 billion, yet <em>“In none of the material examined was there a statement of rationale to  support the differential approach to the funding of government school sectors.  The only account of the means by which methods of calculation were arrived at  was through reference to average costs incurred by state education systems in  operating their schools. There was no evidence of a rationale which would  support the position that the educational needs of secondary students are  greater than those of primary students or more costly to provide … It is  suggested that the reason for the differential treatment is based on historical  prejudice and unexamined assumptions.”</em> (p. 3 – 4)</p>
    <p>The  hidden logic appears to be circular: secondary schools have always been given  more funds, so they cost more to run, so they need to be given more funding to  meet those higher costs.  This rolls into  another circular argument: that larger funds require more people to administer  them, hence more senior and support staff, thus better funding.</p>
    <p>Clearly,  there is a set of assumptions which underpin the differential. Yet each one of  these assumptions can be challenged, particularly in the light of the  inevitable changes to the nature of schooling that will be forced upon us by  the shift to a digital, information age.</p>
    <p><em>Assumption 1</em>: Secondary  schools require more specialist subject teachers; and such specialties cost  money - science laboratories, libraries, computer facilities, sports equipment.  In the new information age, where creativity and the ability to apply knowledge  to new situations are crucial skills, it is not specialised subject matter that  counts, but learning how to learn. Primary school students need highly skilled  mentors and guides in this process, and the staff-student ratio needs to be low  enough to permit group work, individual attention to learning processes and  difficulties. Without that, failure to acquire the basic skills of learning  make a mockery of attempts later on to impart specialist bodies of information.</p>
    <p><em>Assumption 2: </em>Secondary  schools usually have larger enrolments than primary schools, so they need more  administrative and support staff. But size does not equal complexity, and given  the new role as community hub/family resource centre that is envisaged for  primary schools, they will need more, not less, administrative and support  staff than secondary schools. In fact, increased linkages between smaller  schools across regional clusters, and between primary schools and other family  support services will require quite complex administrative systems.</p>
    <p><em>Assumption 3: </em>Secondary  education is more important than primary because it prepares students for  university entrance and/or a job. High school graduates are more valuable to  society because they are closer to becoming a productive part of the labor  force, so they deserve better funding. This is clearly putting the chicken  before the egg. Everything we know about the digital age suggests that specific  vocational skills become rapidly obsolete. The value lies in laying firm  foundations for adaptive learning and lifelong curiosity and creativity. </p>
    <p><em>Assumption 4: </em>Bigger kids  are more difficult to control, or to teach, so they require a better  staff-student ratio to ensure positive learning outcomes. This is manifestly  not true, given the deterioration of parenting skills, behavioral and emotional  control in the family. The variability in children's home background as a  foundation for formal learning is greatest at the start of schooling. Children  need more personal attention, more individualised instruction, closer mentoring  and supervision at that age than later on when the norms of institutional  behavior have come to be accepted. The primary school teacher needs a lot of  time for each student, or the inequalities they bring with them cannot be  overcome.</p>
    <p>It  is important to understand, as background to this discussion about differential  primary-secondary school funding, how the shift towards a knowledge economy  makes it imperative that we develop a fully thought-through rationale for how  our school system should be structured. We cannot afford to operate on  outmoded, or incorrect, assumptions. Nor can we afford to neglect the  foundation years of those who will make Australia a 'learning  nation'.</p>
    <p><strong>Social trends affecting  schools</strong><br />
        <br />
        There  are three main trends affecting the way schools will have to operate in the new  economy. One is the dynamic nature of work structures and processes; a second  is the dramatic change in family structures and family functioning; the third  is the altered balance between government and community partnerships in a  global economy.</p>
    <p>In  simple terms, our schools were designed for an industrial era now gone. Secure  jobs at fixed times, task routines within a carefully coordinated system of  production, bureaucratic rules within a clear hierarchy of command were echoed  in the old school model. Students had to learn basic literacy and numeracy in  order to be productive and work safely; they had to learn conformity to a  timetable and a hierarchy of command; they attended at fixed times and parents  (at least mothers) were expected to be at home to look after them once school  hours finished. Throw in a bit of civic education and physical education for  the health of the body politic, and that was it. The elite paradigm of the  university insisted on individual effort and evaluation, not group assessment  or team work, and universities dominated the structure and processes of  secondary schooling. Primary education was for the masses; secondary was for  the chosen few, with some note taken of inherent as opposed to inherited  talent, since the propertied classes could not keep up an adequate supply of  clever people for industry's needs.</p>
    <p>Today's  workforce needs much more than that and the future demands much greater  complexity, adaptability and creativity. </p>
    <p>We  have already shifted from agriculture, mining and manufacturing to services and  the application of knowledge, not merely its possession. Global flexibility  requires people who can work at any time, any place, shifting between  just-in-time teams and applying what they have learned to new problems in new  circumstances. Team-working ability and inter-personal competence are the new  demand-skills. Females are as crucial to this expanding knowledge economy as  are males; indeed no nation can afford to neglect half the talent base of its  population, nor those of any minority. Creativity, adaptability,  entrepreneurial skills, lateral thinking, emotional intelligence are the  hallmarks of both successful people and successful business organisations.  Deference to hierarchy and rule-bound behaviour are anathema to high  performance and productivity. We will no longer have jobs; we will do work, so  the development of an expansive portfolio of skills and the constant updating  of knowledge will make the difference between surviving and thriving. In short,  the task is learning how to learn and knowing how to live with complexity.</p>
    <p>So  the schools, from primary to secondary and the colleges and universities, must  re-configure their central tasks, or they will become increasingly irrelevant  and even harmful to the nation's future.</p>
    <p>This  change in the structure and processes of work has already had a profound impact  on family life and inter-personal relationships. Marriage is no longer the goal  for many. Women have wider options and they exercise them. Nor is having  children. Young people stay on in education, stay in the parental home, delay  marriage until their mid thirties. But they have a complex intimate life and  seek a balance between long, hard working hours and time for high-energy leisure  pursuits, self-exploration and the satisfaction of mutual self-disclosure in  serial and monogamous relationships. They delay having children, to the point  where our fertility rate is below replacement and over 30 per cent will never  have children, partly because they have waited too long to start, but also  because children get in the way of a career (now better called an open ticket  flight-path) for men as well as for women. So children become even more of a  private choice, and the value of children to society as a whole becomes more  difficult to justify, making expenditure on schools and family support services  ever more problematic.  </p>
    <p>The  impact of new family life has already been felt in the schools. Children are  less often socialised in large families of give-and-take togetherness; many  parents are too tired, busy or confused to provide consistent guidance towards  self-discipline; separation and divorce cause obvious fallout in emotions and  acting-out behaviour; teachers complain of having to serve as social workers  when they are not qualified to do so. My message is, they'd better get used to  it, because family life will become ever more complex, emotional life less  secure and the school acting in loco parentis will be the name of the game.</p>
    <p>Finally,  at the macro level, globalisation and neo-liberal market ideology have brought  about an inevitable change in the role of government and the way Australian  communities relate to the politico-economic system. Witness the scramble to  change a tax system too reliant on income in an age where income can be hidden  not just by huge corporations, but by individuals operating on the worldwide  web. It will take a long time before nations cooperate to collect taxes for  work done in their country by the footloose citizens of another nation.  Witness too, the new importance of regional  politics, the 'spatial economy' and the shift away from one-size-fits-all  solutions to social problems. The nation state as an entity becomes less powerful,  yet more important for the overall wellbeing of its citizens; the wrong moves  economically and politically affect everyone, today more rapidly than ever  before. </p>
    <p>Budget  pressures, new work processes and changed  family life will force schools to stop acting as 'silos' in their own communities.  Hopefully they will also force other silos such as health, family services,  youth, police, aged support, training, etc. to start integrating and  cooperating in more cost-effective partnerships with the schools. Indeed,  global information technology offers both huge possibilities for schools to  become closer to their communities, and a threat to them if they fail to adjust  and offer what communities decide they really need and can get from elsewhere  via the Internet. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Re-structuring primary  schools as foundations for the new age</strong></p>
    <p>The  social trends outlined above have obvious implications for secondary and  tertiary education as well as for primary schools. But my point here is that  they force us especially to rethink the nature of those learning foundations  laid in the early years of schooling.</p>
    <p>The  knowledge economy makes the application of knowledge to problem-solving a core  capacity of the successful citizen-worker. Fixed bodies of information are so  rapidly made obsolete that learning how to learn, knowing which questions to  ask and where to seek appropriate information become far more important. Reading with  comprehension, the capacity to sort out the wheat from the chaff, critical  thinking - literacy in its widest sense – has to take priority. But so too does  the capacity to learn from and with others. Projects which put such skills into  practice are more likely to develop the right learning attitudes and abilities  than the passive transference of subject matter. So team work and practical  group assignments are more useful than an emphasis on individual work and  assessment.</p>
    <p>All  of which implies that the teacher as subject expert is already obsolete,  replaced by the teacher as learning navigator, as information and thinking  guide, as director and coordinator of widely-spread learning exercises,  especially in the primary school, where habits of learning are inculcated and  the need for specialist subject matter knowledge is less pressing. Obsolete too  is the notion that the school is the only seat of learning and education.  Schools have to teach children that knowledge resides in the wider community,  mentors who may be parents, or older adults, or teenagers learning by teaching  others less experienced than themselves. </p>
    <p>Above  all, primary schools must lay the foundations for effective inter-personal  skills and emotional intelligence. Anyone who doubts that this is important  should read Daniel Goleman's book<em> 'Emotional Intelligence: Why it can matter more than IQ'</em> (Bloomsbury, 1996). They  should also see the surveys coming from big business which indicate job  applicants are most lacking in the areas of interpersonal skills and foreign  languages (which involve empathy, cultural understanding, tolerance and highly  skilled negotiating ability in global business development). The paradox is  that business leaders are looking for people with 'soft' skills and 'general  education' capacities, at the very time that our tertiary institutions are more  narrowly focusing on specialist vocational skills likely to be quickly  outmoded. Primary schools can lay the foundations for learning how to learn,  and learning how to relate effectively with other people in a variety of team  and workplace situations.</p>
    <p>Beyond  that, of course, such skills are essential for civic life and the full  functioning of the individual as a human being and as a citizen of a democracy.  The changes affecting family life make primary school the one stable and  positive fulcrum of many children's lives. Primary schools must therefore make  every effort to become a hub of community life and a family resource centre for  children and parents, as well as for other citizens. They can do so by breaking  down the barriers between themselves and parents, adopting the only sensible  philosophy possible – that teachers are partners with parents in the upbringing  of children. Keeping parents and other adults out conveys precisely the wrong  message to children, that only teachers can be learned from and parents are the  enemy, dooming schools to failure. </p>
    <p>Moreover,  we know from the research on family and community breakdown, child abuse and  domestic violence that the school alone can do little to bring about positive  change. When children live in 'toxic communities' (Garbarino, 1995) they cannot  learn or thrive in any other way. So the primary school has to redefine its  task as that of resourcing parents, working in partnership with parents in  bringing up competent, confident future citizens. The primary school is still  the one natural hub of family/community interaction. There is no stigma  attached to coming to school meetings (provided they are not confined to  sorting out problems). And they are the one logical place for the co-location  of family support services such as maternal and child health, child care,  out-of-school hours care, parenting information and education, referral to  family counseling and other programs aimed at strengthening and protecting  family life. The school should be a community hub for all families with  children.</p>
    <p>This  brings me back to my starting point about the inequitable distribution of  educational resources between primary and secondary schools. Such foundations  for learning are absolutely crucial if Australia is to hold  on in the global economy. Throwing money at narrowly vocational training is  counter-productive, whereas properly funding the right learning attitudes and  skills in the early years of schooling will guarantee more effective learning  in the secondary and tertiary years. Higher staff-student ratios in the early  years where the habits of learning and applying knowledge are developed might  prevent failure, ensure full literacy for every child and avoid costly later  patch-up remedial interventions.  </p>
    <p>While  it may be difficult to budge entrenched school funding arrangements, other  resources could be brought closer to the primary schools to help them become  parent-community hubs, family resource centres in the widest sense. The  full-service school model is already proving effective, with many other family  support services co-located on or near the primary school grounds. What is  missing is an overall understanding (on the part of many teachers as well as  the policy makers) that such services are as much a part of education as what  is taught inside the classroom. But the global economy is driving government  towards a better integrated system, less of a silo mentality about the way  taxes are spent, and more of a community-run, locality-based approach to a  whole range of services than the managerial mentality that has dominated over  the last decade would allow. </p>
    <p>Primary  school teachers and administrators would do well to seize the day and encourage  more of this lateral approach to the school-in-community. It might not only add  to the support they seek in being 'social workers' to troubled children; it  might also make the community and politicians more aware of how important are  the foundation years of learning and thus more inclined to redress the current  imbalance between primary and secondary school funding.</p>
