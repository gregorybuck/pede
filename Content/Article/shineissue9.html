<p><em>The argument in  support of special programs for gifted and talented students begins with a  different premise but arrives at the same overall goal of improving schools.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;No one has written your destiny for you. Your destiny is in  your hands.&rdquo; There are &ldquo;no excuses&rdquo; for underachieving, said President Barack  Obama in an address to the NAACP (The National Association for the advancement  of Coloured People) in July this year. <br />
  In exhorting all kids to apply themselves and try harder he  also called on parents to play their part. &ldquo;&hellip;we can&rsquo;t tell our kids to do well  in school and then fail to support them when they get home. You can&rsquo;t just  contract out parenting&hellip; It means pushing our children to set their sights a  little bit higher.&rdquo;&nbsp; <br />
  In a debate challenging  educational thinkers around the world to improve the education of children  generally, there are different points of view about how best to help children  succeed. Is it the child&rsquo;s natural in-born talent that makes the difference (as  we have long believed), is it the school they go to, or is it the teacher or  the parent who pushes their child to excel?<br />
  Barack Obama credits his mother with pushing him, caring  about his education, taking no lip, teaching him right from wrong and insisting  he use his abilities. <br />
  In the same month as President Obama gave his rallying call  for education, Alan Milburn, MP and chairman of the UK Government&rsquo;s panel on  social mobility, delivered his report Unleashing Aspiration. He too spoke of  the key role parents can play claiming &ldquo;Parental interest in a child&rsquo;s  education has four times more influence on attainment by age 16 than does  socio-economic background&rdquo;.<br />
  &lsquo;Pushy parents&rsquo; make a difference in education for all  children, but those with high incomes have additional advantage, they can buy  extra tuition or move near a good school to guarantee a place. <br />
  Parents should push but the school their children go to makes  a difference. &ldquo;A good school&rdquo;, Mr Milburn says, &ldquo;opens the door to a good  career. Generations of low and middle income young people will miss out unless  we do more to close the educational attainment gap in schools&rdquo;. He is an  advocate for paying schools according to the progress their pupils make,  providing an incentive to drive up standards and improve pupil&rsquo;s outcomes.<br />
  The argument in support of special programs for gifted and  talented students begins with a different premise but arrives at the same  overall goal of improving schools.<br />
  In the UK Young, Gifted and Talented is a national program  providing extra educational support for those who excel in one or more academic  subjects, like language and mathmetics, learn faster than others in their year  group or may have high potential but are underachieving. Or they are talented,  with practical skills in areas&nbsp;like sport, music, design or creative and  performing arts. Skills&nbsp;like leadership, decision-making, and organisation  are also taken into account when identifying and providing for gifted and  talented children. <br />
  The national champion of  gifted and talented learners in the UK, John Stannard, sees benefits to schools  as a whole from a systematic focus on providing successfully for able, gifted  and talented learners: lifting standards and expectations for all; more  optimistic and challenging learning and teaching; increased opportunity through  curriculum enrichment;&nbsp; positive and  creative impact on school climate; increasing parental commitment.<br />
  What able children can do, he says, is a good guide to what  should be an entitlement for everyone. A curriculum pitched only at the  average, he says, is unlikely to serve anyone&rsquo;s interests well. <br />
  Surely the aim should be  to devise schools that both challenge the ablest and push the less able to  achieve their best. Whether the goal is to develop unfulfilled talent or skills  to compete in the modern labour marketplace, good schools for all &ndash; staffed  with skilled teachers who work in partnership with parents &ndash; are needed to  educate young people successfully.<br />
  If we get the system  right we still need to monitor the motivation of the individual child. It is  the teacher in the classroom who is best placed to identify talent and motivate  unengaged minds in partnership with a pushy parent. But the child is central in  this partnership.<br />
  My eight-year-old grandson&rsquo;s parent teacher interview &ndash; a  process usually undertaken without the child present &ndash; underwent a  transformation recently with the school encouraging the child to opt-in and  express their views. It proved to be a powerful experience for all involved.  The teacher learned things about the child she wasn&rsquo;t aware of. The boy heard  his teacher and parents suggest a course of action which gave the agreement  more weight in his eyes. He was happy to be included and turned over a new leaf  the next day. It demonstrated how powerful a partnership between a teacher and  parents with a child could be.&nbsp;</p>
