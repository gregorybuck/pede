            The
            commercial television networks are calling for an end to the children's
            television quotas. (The Age 21/7/17) There is nothing new about that. The
            producers want quotas applied across all platforms. But the central issue
            governing children's media should not be to find ways to support an existing
            production industry or relieve the networks of their obligations it should be
            about how best to serve the interests and needs of children.

            The
            industry has always been hostile to the Children's Television Standards (CTS)
            since they were first mooted in 1976. They claimed then they did not have the
            resources for such programming. They asserted they did not know what a
            children's program looked like, that Australian kids couldn't act and they
            would not watch such programs.

            The
            networks have cried the proverbial 'wolf' for 40 years. First, they said the
            high costs of technology in converting to colour in 1976 would consume all
            their revenue. Colour proved to be a bonanza. And when the Australian
            Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) set up the Children's Program Committee (CPC) to
            implement the Standards in 1979, the networks undermined the process by
            withdrawing their representative. Fifteen commercial television licensees
            challenged the validity of the ABT's power to classify programs, in the Federal
            Court. They lost, but pursued their argument in the High Court which held the
            ABT's Standards were invalid. So Labor's Communication Minister, Michael Duffy,
            introduced an Amendment Bill affirming the ABT's powers. Finally the networks
            had no choice but to comply or risk losing their license. This process took
            eight years.

            For the
            following decade the system of subsidy and regulation worked. Quality drama was
            produced which attracted the child audience and spawned both a domestic and
            international industry. But in 1995, with the best of intentions, the
            Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) made a strategic error. They doubled
            the quota and things began to unravel. It was easier to fill the quota with
            long running series and animations undermining the diversity of live-action
            programs. The bigger problem was that the Film Finance Corporation (FFC), the
            major source of funding for children's programs, was facing cut backs. In 1994
            the FFC invested $ 20 million, 23% of its funding into children's programs. By
            1998 their investment had dropped to $9.3 million. This was when the drama
            quota doubled.

            Networks,
            aware of this problem, drove down license fees and squeezed producers. The
            number of live-action productions and the number of active producers declined.
            The networks met their quotas but buried programs and did nothing to entice an
            audience. The problems were exposed by the ABA's evaluation of&nbsp;

            Enter the
            idea of an ABC digital children's television channel. Big promises were made
            and exaggerated claims persist about this experiment. The ABC Managing
            Director, Mark Scott claimed it would mean 'the renaissance of children's
            television'. Prime Minister Rudd went along with the channel. Then the ABC
            decided they would have, not one, but two digital children's channels – one for
            preschoolers and one for school-age children. That meant 10,192 hours of
            programming to schedule across a year. And how could these hours be filled but
            by animations and low cost, studio-based repeat programs, which is what the ABC
            called for? They needed them quickly – 'think adult formats like

            These
            channels filled a vacuum for a brief time as they were the only free-to-air all
            day show on the box. But then, as those in the industry should have known, the
            audience began to shrivel. We knew from research studies, as early as ten years
            ago, in the UK, in the USA and in Australia, that kids were deserting scheduled
            television.

            This means
            the networks now have a legitimate point. The audience they have been running
            away from for forty years is running away from them. But the answer, as they
            are urging, is not to abandon the quotas and redirect the funds to prime time
            programs. They have a responsibility to the community, as licensees, for their
            privileged role. The $30 million dollars they have been spending belongs to
            children's programming and should be levied to help support a new service.

            ABC, now being castigated for reducing their program expenditure on children,

            children's service. Close down ABC3. Consolidate and refresh ABC2 for 2-9 year
            olds, for there is no more important group of viewers deserving priority than
            those in their early years. Education does not begin when children go to
            pre-school or school for the first time. Eighty-five per cent of brain
            development takes place in the first few years of life.There is a great
            opportunity here, as part of the media reviews, to accommodate quality early
            childhood programs into the policy mix. This is a legitimate role for a public
            broadcaster. The BBC earlier this month announced additional funding of 31.4
            million pounds over three years for on-line projects in an attempt to remain
            relevant for their child audience.

            For

            appropriate for their needs and interests. It should be redesigned from the
            ground up. This service should be accessible across multiple platforms
            accommodating distribution to a desk-top, online or to mobile devices. It
            should be a robust, flexible, platform that lets kids do what they want in the
