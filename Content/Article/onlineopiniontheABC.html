<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:black'>Do we need the ABC? The Prime Minister Tony Abbott and his
Ministers - Scott Morrison, Julie Bishop, David Johnstone, Malcolm Turnbull,
Joe Hockey and former Minister Peter Reith have described the national
broadcaster as biased, unpatriotic, endowed with more money than it knows what
to do with. Their critiques are championed by the Murdoch media which has long
asserted the ABC competes unfairly. Gay Alcorn (<a
href="http://www.theage.com.au/comment/dominant-abc-hurting-the-commercial-sector-20140213-32n3r.html">Age Feb 14</a>) has added
weight to the argument that public subsidy gives the ABC an unfair advantage
over commercial media.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>There is a long established
belief, that in a democratic society a well informed electorate is vital and
television, not the press, has become our culture's principal window on the
world. As far back as 1960, John Kennedy commented when he saw a replay of his
debates with Richard Nixon, 'We wouldn't have had a prayer without that thing.'
(television). Tony Abbott understands that thinking.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>It is easy to underestimate our
PM. The iron-man image and halting speaking style mask a highly intelligent
man, Jesuit trained with an inclination to Jesuitical argument – find the words
to justify anything - a former journalist with an understanding of how the
media work; an experienced and ambitious politician who has thought deeply
about how to get into power and how to stay there. Managing the media is an
essential part of the process and Abbott knows the main threat to his long term
agenda is the ABC. The claim of 'torture' by the Navy provided a plausible
trigger so he made his move.</span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:black'>Alain De Botton in his most recent book<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><em><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>The
News&nbsp;</span></em>writes 'news now occupies a position of power at least
equal to that formerly enjoyed by the faiths'. Most of us are lucky to spend 12
years in the classroom and our ongoing education is then drawn from the
airwaves and our screens. De Botton believes that news broadcasting is the
prime creator of political and social reality.</span></p>

-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>Abbott's approach to this reality
in opposition was to campaign with negative slogans providing little
information; the technique worked, he was elected. Since becoming PM he has
followed the same plan; tell the media and the public as little as possible by
censoring 'operational' facts. Condemn those who ask questions as unpatriotic.
This has led to the current confrontation with the ABC.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>Abbott's attack on the ABC comes
at an interesting time in global broadcasting politics.He is not alone in his
views. On January 27 this year<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><em><span
style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>The Guardian</span></em><span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>reported Katsuto Momii , the Chairman
of NHK, Japan's influential, publicly funded, national broadcaster, had cast
doubt on NHK's commitment to editorial independence when he said it was 'only
natural' for the broadcaster to side with the government's position on
contentious issues in its international output'.</span></p>

<p style='background:white;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;
-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>There were immediate calls for
Momii's resignation which he countered by insisting he was speaking in a
private capacity. But journalists pointed out the comments were made during a
press conference in his role as chairman of NHK. Political interference with a
public broadcaster is a sensitive issue globally.</span></p>

<p style='background:white;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;
-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>The BBC, the bulwark of public
broadcasting, is also under scrutiny from politicians in the UK. John Tate
former BBC director of policy and strategy, recently gave a Ted Talk
entitled'The BBC's independence rests on being influenced by the public, not
politicians'. He stated:</span></p>

<p style='background:white'><em><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:black'>Worryingly, the BBC has been shifting further on to the
government's books of late … It is no coincidence that this has coincided with
the raiding of its licence fee for state projects. One could even be forgiven
for thinking that parliament had become its governing body – with no fewer than
18 BBC appearances before parliamentary committees in the year to last November</span></em><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>.</span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:black'>Is this what we are now to expect for the ABC in Australia?</span></p>

font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>A favourite adage of critics
since broadcasting began is to insist both commercial and public radio and
television broadcasters should be 'balanced'. But balance/ fairness / equal
time are tricky concepts that have become tools to whip into line those putting
an unpopular argument. It is assumed that balance will correct for bias by a
broadcasting institution or journalist doing a story, but it won't when there
is no sensible and coherent case against or no informed spokesperson to put a
counter argument.Do you give a creationist equal time in a discussion on
evolution? Do you allow a holocaust denier, a pedophile priest, a jihadist, a
racist, equal time to put their case? Should climate skeptics have equal time
to counter the case put by the large majority of the world's climate
scientists? Now four million Australians are said to be mentally ill, do you
give equal time to those arguing this is a problem created by over enthusiastic
doctors? And do you give an asylum seeker who claims to have seen navy
personnel deliberately burn the hands of fellow - passengers equal time with
the Navy? Our political leaders say it was an unpatriotic and biased act to air
this report.</span></p>

jingoism rears its head we are on a slippery slope.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>The first Managing Director of
the BBC Lord John Reith appointed in 1926, succeeded in arguing the BBC should
be run at arm's length from the government of the day; the public interest was
to be the first priority. Our ABC which came into being 6 years later, modeled
on the BBC, adopted the same philosophy and arguments about bias with the
Governments of the day, who determine budgets, have persisted.</span></p>

font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>In the USA the discussion about
balance was equally fraught. Radio broadcasting journalism had come of age
during World War 2. Edward Murrow a CBS reporter emerged as the icon shaping
news reporting and his program<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><em><span
style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>See it Now</span></em>represented
television's arrival as a news medium. The program took on prominent targets
including Senator Joe McCarthy and his highly publicised hearings, alleging
communist sympathizers had infiltrated US public institutions.</span></p>

<p style='background:white;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;
-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>CBS's policy was that journalists
should be impartial but Murrow took the view that some issues were not equally
balanced and he decided to editorialise at the end of his program, something
that had not been done before.</span></p>

<p style='background:white;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;

color:black'>&nbsp;</span></i></span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>was an effective program earning kudos and
awards. It helped expose McCarthy and his tactics but as US television grew
more profitable the industry began to shun controversy in news and current
events. Murrow lost both his sponsor ALCOA and his slot in prime time.</span></p>

-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>In October 1958 Murrow made an
angry speech in Chicago to the Radio-Television News Directors Association. 'I
am frightened by the imbalance, the constant striving to reach the largest
possible audience for everything; by the absence of a sustained study of the
state of the nation.'</span></p>

-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>Eventually the US Public
Broadcasting model would emerge but it has been the poor partner in the broadcasting
mix. The 'fairness doctrine' introduced in 1949 by the US Federal Communication
Commission which involved granting equal time was repealed by President Reagan
in 1987, opening the door to the national right wing radio talk shows - an
entertainment genre that purported to challenge and inform but seems to hold a
devastatingly low opinion of the public mentality.</span></p>

<p style='background:white;orphans: auto;text-align:start;widows: auto;
-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>Public broadcasting remains an
essential asset in a democratic society and surveys have shown repeatedly that
the public trust the ABC. A news service in the public interest should be based
on seeking and telling the truth. This is a very different objective from
balance and one fundamental to democratic principles. Truth will emerge only
when trained professional journalists are permitted to do their job without
intimidation. The ABC must be adequately resourced to do this work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:

it is time to be afraid.</span></span></p>
