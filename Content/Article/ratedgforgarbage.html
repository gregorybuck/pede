rules around program standards, specific Australian quotas, subsidised

Screen Australia's Convergence 2011 report points out, don't Australian children
want to watch the Australian programs that are being produced for them?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>The
Children's Program Classification system under the Australian Broadcasting
Tribunal began as a vigorous public process that emphasised innovation,
creativity and quality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Over the
years, three regulatory bodies bureaucratised the process to make it easier for
the networks, which went about making programs focusing on political
correctness rather than originality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
12.75pt;vertical-align:baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>The
authorities also bent the rules to allow animation series to qualify, which
diluted the cultural intention of the quota by allowing networks to buy cheap
program packages that, though made in Australia, were often the product of
multinational producers and could have been made anywhere.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Having won
concessions, the networks go about their business quietly, doing the minimum
required. The standards are no longer working and radical new thinking is
needed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>The Film
Finance Corporation aided this dumbing down of children's programs by accepting
reduced licence fees and turning a blind eye to the projects initiated or
controlled overseas. Some Australian producers even help outsiders tap into
funds intended for authentic Australian productions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>The
children's media lobbyists who were so active in the '70s and '80s, are missed.
In part they have been conned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>The
Children's Television Foundation has become a funder and distributor for
independent producers rather than a producer. It acted as a lobbyist for the
ABC's third channel and is silent on any vision for the future of children's
programs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>ABC3 had the
appearance of a win. A Children's Channel would help drive digital TV take-up;
it was an action flowing from the 2020 Summit (of which there were few); it was
a win for the ABC's digital strategy and it appeared to be a win for children.
But no one who understood the economics of children's programming and the
dramatically changing media milieu of children believed the spin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>What we got
is a clone of the commercial channels that emerged in the 1990s when the idea
was new. The quality programs touted are few and far between. To fill the
endless hours and reach the promised target of 50 per cent Australian, the ABC
has sent out calls for programs that will be high volume, low cost, and made
fast. They ask for good ideas but good ideas are the product of intense work.
The programs we see on the ABC's digital channels add little of value.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

director of the Children's Television Foundation languishes on the shelf.&nbsp;</span><i><span
style='font-size:11.5pt;font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Lift Off</span></i><span
style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>, an early childhood program
made mostly with public funds, cost $19 million in the '90s. The ABC killed it
by taking it off air and won't screen it now because they say it is dated. It
competes with that other even more dated show,&nbsp;</span><i><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:

voting with their eyeballs, watching, as Screen Australia's research reveals,
other very dated shows.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>When we began
to fight for children's programs 35 years ago our aim was to protect and
promote quality. Today the challenge of convergence with the resulting global,
highly competitive and commercialised marketplace is changing the assumptions
that have long underpinned broadcasting systems and their content development.
Local child audiences have lost out, yet for creative producers, new media
could offer great opportunities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Young people
are leading the media revolution. Older kids with internet access are leaving
television behind altogether; they have moved on to gaming, chat rooms, instant
messaging and the joys of online content they create themselves. For children
in the middle years, television is still important but it is often background
noise while they play with their electronic gadgets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>In the
children's media world it is time to revisit our values and perhaps create
entirely new ones. Policies formed 30 years ago will not do. Why can't we focus
on where we can have most impact (when children are watching) rather than
drip-feed filler all day when they are at school?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>In order to
attract children to relevant, appropriate material that is designed with their
best interests at heart, producers and channel managers need to be more
innovative, more experimental, take more risks than they do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>We need
independent, new, innovative multi-platform services to deliver children's
programs. They should accommodate games, chat rooms, downloadable libraries,
opportunities to access, manipulate, create and share multimedia content that
meets young people's needs and interests. They should have a global reach for
interaction with other cultures and engage with the education revolution. One
arm of government should be speaking to the other. Media policy should reflect
education policy with its emphasis on the early childhood curriculum.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:

really think old sitcoms are good enough?</span></p>
