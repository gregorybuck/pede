<p><em>Research  demonstrates that it is not innate talent but practice &ndash; concentrated,  gruelling effort &ndash; that makes someone excel at what they do.</em><br />
  </p>
<p>How many times have we heard the claim that someone is a born  leader, or that an athlete, musician, or writer has natural talent?&nbsp; Such assertions let the rest of us off the  hook. We couldn&rsquo;t be expected to demonstrate such success if we weren&rsquo;t born  smart like Einstein or Darwin, or athletic like Tiger Woods or David Beckham. <br />
  But remember the little  engine that could: <em>I think I can, I  think I can</em>, it said as it  chugged its big load up the incline.<br />
  The belief that we are  born to win is under challenge from the Swedish researcher Anders Ericsson  whose research demonstrates that it is not innate talent but practice;  concentrated, gruelling effort that makes someone excel at what they do. He  recommends &lsquo;deliberate practice&rsquo; as the path to brilliance; apply yourself from  an early age and almost everyone has the capacity to excel he argues. (Shelly  Gare, &lsquo;Success is all in the mind&rsquo;, <em>The Australian, </em>January 24, 2009).<br />
  John Stuart Mill, the  19th-century English philosopher, was one such success story. He was crammed  with learning by his father from an early age and duly developed as a prodigy  whose prolific writings have stood the test of time. Mozart, commonly regarded  as a genius, had by the age of six actually studied music for 3500 hours and  wrote his first masterwork at age 21.<br />
  I have seen my  grandchildren master spelling, times tables, ball games, magic tricks, the  rubic cube, drumming and dancing when they have been so determined to do so  they practise and practise. But how do you inspire such hard work and  persistence, and how can a teacher turn a kid who is disinterested into a  highly motivated student willing to engage in &lsquo;deliberate practice&rsquo;?<br />
  Praise can be a powerful  motivator, but not all praise is equal. Carol Dweck, a psychologist at Stanford  University in California has studied smart kids and their achievements and found  that too much praise can backfire, leading to performance anxiety and sapping  motivation.&nbsp; Smart kids have been told so  often how great they are they see all peers as rivals, often lie about their  test scores, and actually perform less well the more praise they get for being  smart. <br />
  In contrast, when they are  praised for the process &ndash; how they tackle a maths problem rather than whether  or not they get it right &ndash; and for trying, for the effort put into a task,  their performance improves.&nbsp; Emphasising  effort gives the child a variable that they can control.&nbsp; Emphasising natural intelligence takes the  task out of the child&rsquo;s control, and provides no good recipe for responding to  failure.&nbsp; <br />
  This is a powerful lesson  for parents as well as teachers.&nbsp; Kids have  a pretty good inbuilt crap detector. They know when praise is false and when  praise given is not warranted and it&rsquo;s pretty scary having to be best all the  time.&nbsp; <br />
  Ericsson believes in constant critical feedback and in  pushing beyond what has already been achieved: &lsquo;Improvement is never  effortless&rsquo;, <br />
  he argues. <br />
  This means telling  children that hard work, effort and persistence are the path to achievement. We  need to rethink the way we deal with children. It&rsquo;s no longer a matter of doing  well in standard school tests and getting through to college or university.  It&rsquo;s more a matter of cultivating minds that are capable of thinking and acting  in disciplined, creative ways through sustained effort; learning a capacity for  hard work and sticking at a task until it is fully understood &ndash; whether it is  maths, pottery, cricket or a foreign language. This takes years of consistent  effort.<br />
  Yes, developing children  need a confident sense of themselves, they need to feel they can tackle any  task and achieve some level of competence, but they don&rsquo;t need to be told  continually how clever they are.&nbsp; It is  the experience of real success that makes them feel good about themselves. </p>
