<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>If the
Government succeeds in degrading the ABC our democracy will be imperiled.
'Learn to use it and not to abuse it', the legendary news reporter, Ed Murrow
said of television on the day of the first live US coast to coast link in 1949.
With those words sixty-five years ago he captured the dilemma at the heart of
news media reporting ever since Murrow's heyday at the US Network CBS.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>The quest
for profits from newspaper sales and commercial television ratings has
systematically eroded news values over decades and divided the journalism
profession. Just as the mass media can enlighten us through courageous, well
documented investigative reporting, they can condemn us to ignorance with their
focus on entertainment masquerading as news. The public's right to know is the
banner bandied about by all sides.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>Ironically
it is cinema, the greatest art form for the masses ever created, that repeatedly
sounds the alarm about the ways news reporting can distort information, degrade
our democracy and ultimately damage our civility and citizenship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>Films
regularly make the point that the Fourth Estate is vital in uncovering the
truth and maintaining our democracy. But journalism can be life threatening
work, particularly when 'the good guys' prove to have feet of clay. Films that
hammer the point have starred Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford (</span><i><span

films in this genre reinforce the challenges journalists face as professionals
in this cut throat industry:</span><span style='font-size:12pt;font-family:

the third series of the television series</span><span style='font-size:12pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>&nbsp;<i>Newsroom,&nbsp;</i></span><span
style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>screening
currently, highlights the struggle journalists engage in to be first with the
news in the digital age.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>In</span><span
style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>&nbsp;<i>Kill
the Messenger</i>&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:black'>Jeremy Renner plays the journalist, Gary Webb, who wrote a
three-part series for a small paper,</span><span style='font-size:12pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>&nbsp;<i>The San Jose Mercury,</i>&nbsp;</span><span
style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>exposing
the links between the CIA, the Contras - the guerillas they were training to
fight the democratically elected Sandinistas in Nicaragua - and the crack
explosion in the ghettos of the United States. Webb followed a trail of
contacts who alleged the Contras funded their war by selling cocaine for arms
with the knowledge of the CIA.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>The furore
that followed publication led to demands for an inquiry into the CIA and
attacks on Webb by the major press, who had missed the story, but then
questioned Webb's sources. The CIA has been notorious in manipulating the press
and they put pressure on Webb's editor, who had backed his journalist, to deny
the story. Then some of Webb's sources 'disappeared'.</span><span
style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>&nbsp;<i>The
San Jose Mercury's</i>&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size:12pt;font-family:

lost his job.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>The film
stops there but some years later Webb was found with a suicide note by his side
and two bullets in his head. He was apparently very determined to end his life.
Subsequently the CIA admitted they knew of the 'arms for crack' deal, so it
seems Webb had his story pretty well right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>Several
filmshave taken a darkly satirical look at the highly competitive world of
television news and the depths to which news editors will sink to win at their
game. We remember</span><span style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:black'>&nbsp;<i>Network&nbsp;</i></span><span style='font-size:12pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>released in 1976 when serious
doubts were being expressed about the quality of the information we were being
fed by television.</span><span style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:black'>&nbsp;<i>Network</i>&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size:12pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>is a scorching parody which
demonstrates that without professional restraint in the news room public
executions would undoubtedly continue to pull a crowd.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>Howard
Beale (Peter Finch) the news reader is burnt out: his personal life has fallen
apart and his ratings have collapsed. In a moment of crisis he announces on air
he plans 'to blow his brains out a week from today.' An ambitious program commissioner
who believes TV news is really only show-business convinces the network to
leave Beale on air in a format where he can articulate his rage alongside a
segment showcasing the activities of a terrorist group, with Sadie the
Soothsayer as part of the mix.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>The
ratings go through the roof. Beale tells his 40 million viewers 'Open the
window, stick your head out and say I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take
it anymore'. The power of the film's message resonated so effectively that
almost 40 years later Shaun Micallef can still trade on Beale's madness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>The most
recent example of the genre is</span><span style='font-size:12pt;font-family:
"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>&nbsp;<i>'Nightcrawlers</i></span><span
style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>', those
freelance news videographers who race around cities at night listening to
police scanners so they can seek out human disasters, track accidents,
shootings, chase ambulances and fire trucks in pursuit of horrific images of
human misfortune they can sell to the US nightly cable news programs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>Jake
Gyllenhaal is Lou Bloom, a nondescript but asocial, mental defective who finds
his vocation peddling sleeze and horror to a cable channel. Nothing fazes him,
even extortion and murder. He makes himself indispensible to Nina, an
unscrupulous, ambitious, news editor played by Rene Russo. No tale is too lurid
for Nina. If it bleeds it leads. And the plausible, smooth-talking Lou stops at
nothing to get the images that will shock. In this film Lou Bloom gets no
come-uppance; he thrives.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span

the message in 2014?What was once prophetic in movies like</span><span
style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>&nbsp;<i>Network</i>&nbsp;</span><span

"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>&nbsp;<i>Nightcrawler&nbsp;</i></span><span
style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>paints a
gruesome picture, of how low the once noble profession of journalism, espoused
by Edward Murrow and showcased in</span><span style='font-size:12pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>&nbsp;<i>Good Night and Good Luck</i>&nbsp;</span><span
style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>has sunk.
George Clooney's film portrays Murrow's exposure of the persecution perpetrated
by Senator Joseph McCarthy in his search for the so-called Reds threatening
American democracy. It was brave journalism to take McCarthy on. Murrow stood
tall when others cowered but ultimately he too was shown the door by CBS
because his ideals for news reporting were incompatible with high ratings and
the corporate interests of the masters at CBS.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>In today's
competitive technological age, when the industry is struggling to find its

your integrity? In the television series</span><span style='font-size:12pt;

complexities for contemporary news journalists bound by ethical investigative
processes, but competing with the immediacy of social media where anyone can be
first with the news. Professional journalists must be sure of their facts
before they print or broadcast for the damage from false reports can be
catastrophic.</span><span style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:black'>&nbsp;<i>Newsroom</i></span><span style='font-size:12pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>dramatizes the vulnerability of
journalists to legal challenge as laws protecting their sources are no longer
guaranteed. And as Assange and Snowden have demonstrated whistle-blowing is a
dangerous practice. These issues are good fodder for fiction but they are also
genuine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>And this
is where the ABC comes in. A democratic society requires a first class,
vigorous Fourth Estate. We need news and current affairs programs that are well
resourced with competent experienced and fearless journalists who are confident
their organization will back them as they pursue the truth for the public who
do have a right to know. A public broadcaster must be independent of Government
and commercial interests. The ABC has been established to fulfill this role. It
is tricky. The institution is under siege, no doubt about that. But we need the
ABC.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>Newspapers
are shrinking in number and substance, their power declining and many fine
journalists have lost their jobs. We can't believe what we see on commercial
television when their mission is to entertain, win ratings and make profits.
Truth is not their prime value. If we get one shred of insight from commercial
news that's a bonus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:12pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>If we
can't trust the news we get from the mass media and we can't trust our
politicians where are we headed as a democracy? We do trust the ABC even though
they sometimes make mistakes in judgment. If this government is responsible for
diminishing the quality of the ABC's news and current affairs programs then we
all lose. The public may just get madder than hell and decide we are not going
to take it anymore.</span></p>
