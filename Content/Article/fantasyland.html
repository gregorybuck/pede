    <p> Get up and Grow,  the guidelines for healthy eating and exercise in early childhood, part  of the Federal Government's anti-obesity drive, are nearing release.  They recommend children should be banned from watching television until  they turn two and from two to age five viewing should be limited to one  hour a day.</p>
    <p>Such policy recommendations emanate  from a fantasyland where officials never seem to learn from the past or  understand the real world where most of us live. </p>
    <p>Television  is omnipresent and a powerful means of educating young children. It has  always been true that one-third of children do two-thirds of the  viewing and many of these heavy viewers are children who live in  disadvantaged families. This fact of life provides educators with an  opportunity.</p>
    <p>There have been only two comprehensive  educational experiments that have attempted to fundamentally change the  focus of early childhood education through television. The first was <em>Sesame Street</em> developed 50 years ago to address disadvantage among American preschoolers; the second was <em>Lift Off</em>,  developed in the '90s by the Australian Children's Television  Foundation. In both cases the television program was the centre-piece  for a nationwide community outreach program with support materials  designed for families, carers and teachers.</p>
    <p><em>Lift Off</em> exemplified the way in which the media and the education system could  work together with parents to create a valuable resource for the  education of children. The process of collaboration worked, but the  ABC, for its own political purposes, took the program off air and the  project collapsed.</p>
    <p>As a concept, <em>Lift Off</em> was ahead of its time but that time has come again with the Government  acknowledging the vital importance of early childhood education.</p>
    <p>Education  does not begin when children go to preschool or school for the first  time. Eighty five per cent of brain development takes place in the  first few years of life. Research has taught us that infants and  toddlers' brains are voraciously active from birth and that  disadvantage in society is born when young children's education is  neglected. </p>
    <p>The major influence on children's  learning comes from the home, from parents, without a formal teacher,  with no clear curriculum and with few conscious goals. Community,  culture and place are important influences. So the starting point of  all formal early childhood education has to be each child's unequal and  diverse family and community background and an attempt to expand each  child's horizons beyond what has already happened to them. </p>
    <p>That  means working with parents as much as with children and ensuring the  broader social environment – the neighbourhood playgrounds, shopping  centres and mass media - supports and enriches the experiences of every  child as they grow. </p>
    <p>Former British education  minister Alan Milburn, in his recent report Unleashing Aspiration,  emphasised the central importance of &quot;pushy parents&quot;. So did US  President Barack Obama in his &quot;no excuses&quot; call to the underprivileged  to improve their lot.</p>
    <p>But parents need government  to help them make a difference. Some children are born into a world  rich in resources and experiences while others are deprived from the  start. And this is where the Government should focus its attention.</p>
    <p>The  kindergarten movement began as a philanthropic attempt to redress  working-class disadvantage; the maternal and child health system was  set up to ensure every parent had access to professional health care  and sound advice on child development; child care was to ensure a safe  environment for the children of employed parents; primary schools were  made free and compulsory to help remove the disadvantages of the  working poor. None of these reforms were meant simply to develop  services for the already privileged.</p>
    <p>So what of the  new policy initiative from the Council of Australian Governments  (COAG)? The first Early Years Learning Framework for Australia is  intended to make sure all children from birth to five years and through  the transition to school get off to a good start in life. It has  recently been released for trial and comment.</p>
    <p>In  the introduction, the document states that the Framework &quot;has been  designed for use by early childhood educators working in partnership  with families, children's first and most influential educators&quot;.  Following that acknowledgement the document has nothing further to say  to parents but goes on to address, in professional jargon, only those  educators working in formal child care and preschool settings.</p>
    <p>The  Learning Framework for birth-five skirts round the inequalities and  disadvantages that exist for many children by addressing the general  themes of &quot;Belonging, Being and Becoming&quot; - goals that remind teachers  that every child needs to be included, to feel they belong, that they  should not be pushed too quickly towards formally defined educational  outcomes. </p>
    <p>The framework's five outcomes for  children are listed as having a strong sense of identity; feeling  connected with and able to contribute to their world; having a strong  sense of wellbeing; being confident and involved learners; and being  effective communicators.</p>
    <p>These are worthy  objectives but missing is the content and the means by which each of  those objectives can be achieved for the diverse child population  entering preschool. There is no notion of how child care or  kindergarten teachers can overcome gaps in wellbeing or confidence or  communication skills that derive from the home. The framework is not  informed by a theory of intelligence or developing competence. </p>
    <p>Apart  from a list of desired outcomes there is no discourse on what sort of  experiences the child-care centre or playgroup or kindergarten might  provide to expand the horizons of children from disadvantaged homes, or  on the effectiveness of praise for effort and process rather than  results. The dominant philosophy is &quot;play-based learning&quot; with a nod in  the direction of teacher-directed play and with few mentions of the  need for teachers to use the ever-more potent media technologies at the  disposal of most children.</p>
    <p>This blinkered approach,  which makes only passing mention of learning outside formal child care  and kindergartens, will do nothing for the development of most toddlers  in their vital formative years and leaves parents out in the cold  without help and guidance at the same time as too many children are  falling through the kindergarten gap (<em>The Age</em> 14/10) </p>
    <p>Soon  parents are to be informed they should ban their children from watching  television as part of the Government's anti-obesity drive. The onus is  to be thrown back on parents to cope, with government abdicating a role  in ensuring the television programs available to children during these  years provide educational and entertainment value appropriate for their  rapidly expanding brain power.</p>
    <p>The important early  years at home are being ignored within our first national framework and  the education revolution, which began with such a bang, is wandering  along through assorted bureaucratic tunnels with no one looking at  children's environment as a whole. A critically important opportunity  for integrated child policy is being missed again.</p>
    <p>The  new Early Years Learning Framework for Australia is still in  development. It presents an opportunity to reach parents, to use  constructively the ubiquitous media and influence those who shape the  wider social environment of Australian children, as well as teachers,  with a comprehensive statement on early childhood education.</p>
