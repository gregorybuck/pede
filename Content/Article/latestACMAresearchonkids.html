            The contentious issue of obligatory quotas for commercial
            children's television is now under review and has polarised the industry. The
            commercial networks say the quotas are no longer valid as children aren't
            watching and they can no longer afford them, and the production industry argues
            that without these programs children will be denied stories that are essential
            to their cultural development. But, does available research show that
            Australian children still want to watch the programs made specifically for them
            under the regulations that have been in force since the 1980's? It does not
            seem so.

            The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) is
            charged with regulating television content to ensure children 'have access to
            quality TV programming' and are 'protected from the possible harmful effects of
            television'. One could therefore expect that ACMA's Report on&nbsp;<i>
                Children's
                television viewing and multi-screen behaviour&nbsp;
            </i>released in August 2017
            would assist the review that's underway. That review aims to evaluate the
            efficacy of current regulations in achieving their stated cultural objectives
            but the ACMA report fails abysmally to properly inform that inquiry.

            The report offers no analysis of quality or harm, and only an
            indirect assessment of children's TV quotas (for P and C classified programs
            including Australian C drama). The study does show clearly that kids now spend
            more time online than they do watching television, but the research is so
            poorly designed and reported that it is misleading. It claims at the outset - a
            claim producers have seized upon - that 'broadcast TV viewing remains an
            important part of the way Australian children and families access children's
            programming'; that the decline in viewing is 'slow' and 'they (children) are
            still watching programs specifically made for them' as 'a regular part of daily
            life'.

            A lay person could therefore assume ACMA's regulations are
            achieving their aim. But dig into the data and a different, confused picture,
            emerges.

            The studies were conducted by OmniPoll, a ratings agency using
            people meters in TV households restricted to the five major cities. The first
            misleading feature of this report is that the conclusions are drawn from data
            that lumps together children aged 0-14 into one group. There are in fact three
            groups that fall within that category, with very different viewing behaviour
            and media usage patterns. Pre-schoolers' viewing is under the control of their
            parents, so it is to be expected they will be watching more scheduled
            television. They form the major viewing group in the 0-14 category. But simply
            separating pre-schoolers 0-4 from 5-12 year olds still gives a misleading
            pattern. There is a stage around 8-9 years where viewing tastes change - the
            5-7's will trend toward the viewing favoured by pre-schoolers but the 8/9-12
            year olds go searching for more stimulating fare and they become more mobile.
            The report shows no understanding of this difference and thus it fails to offer
            any meaningful data on trends away from scheduled free-to-air viewing overall.
            12-14 year olds are different again, as they have entered puberty, their
            friends have become their focus, and they have moved to mobile devices and
            spend time online on social media.

            The second major problem in the Report is that the category
            'children's programming' is defined as 'any screen content' including all TV
            programs, movies, videos, games or DVDs (on any devices) and there is no
            attempt to differentiate Australian television quota programs from programming
            in different formats viewed on multiple devices. 'Children's programs' viewed
            on any device are not quota or Australian programs and data inconsistently
            differentiated into relevant age groups is of little help to decide future
            policy.

            Thirdly, the key findings from the parallel survey of parents,
            carers and guardians about their children's viewing habits, is clearly
            unreliable. The online survey sample is made up of unrepresentative 'opt-in'
            participants, which is acknowledged right at the back of the report (Appendix
            B, p. 43) as 'not without its limitations', such as 'recall bias and socially
            desirable answers'. In fact, the adult sample is biased towards the
            tertiary-educated, higher-income groups most likely to have access to the
            internet and to have thought about the issues of potential concern raised. So
            it is not possible to draw conclusions about the general population from the data.

            Overall, this latest ACMA report merely confirms - but states
            less clearly - what it had found in 2007 - and what OfCom in the UK had found
            in 2007, as well as the Kaiser Foundation in the USA had found in three
            separate Reports in 1999, 2004 and 2009. That is, that children, increasingly,
            as they move out of the pre-school years, have turned away from free-to-air
            television viewing and use the internet and mobile devices not just to watch
            television but to play games, view video clips (especially&nbsp;<i>YouTube</i>)
            make their own video content and interact on social media , preferring
            'programs' which they can control on-demand when and where they wish.

            When they are watching television the top five Australian

            Most viewing in the 0-14 age group is done by pre- schoolers and

            findings most relevant to any inquiry about children's TV standards and quota
            requirements, but ACMA has chosen to highlight the notion that 'Broadcast TV
            viewing remains an important part of the way Australian children and families
            access children's programming.' (Overview, p. 1) The report does not spell out
            the fact that quota programs don't feature highly in children's viewing, unless
            they are oversees programs made for the younger audience, usually in the UK. So
            the main finding of the report is, to say the least, misleading.

            ACMA states, 'the TV set is the most frequently used device to
            view children's programs', but live broadcast TV is used daily by just 19% of
            'all children', a definition that includes pre-schoolers as well as teenagers,
            and most data tables in the report fail to differentiate between younger and
            older C standards-level (5-12) children. No table offers a breakdown by
            children's socio-economic status or access to the internet. An average of 2.9
            platforms is used by the sample, with 45% of children using four or more
            platforms and they are 'multi-tasking' as the television is on, even doing
            homework. Can this be called 'viewing'?

            Not surprisingly, children aged 0-4 predominantly watched ABC2,

            The decline in free-to-air TV viewing is consistent across all

            average) but figures are low and have declined markedly since 2005. The data

            The assertions that have been made about the success of ABC

            programs among pre-school children (aged 0-4).' But they show that only 4.7% of

            1,464,776 children aged 0-4, so although the report claims that 4.7% is a rise

            of a program.' They don't care where it originates.

            All we can learn about C and P programming from the Report is
            that the shift to programming on multi-channels meant a significant drop for
            the top rating program in 2005 (185,000 viewers), into just 41,000 in 2016. To
            learn more about quota programs and who is watching, ACMA's research overview
            from 2015 is more useful. Children 0-4 represent the biggest audience of
            children's programs. Twenty one of thirty top programs were made in the UK in
            2013, just three were Australian. Perhaps most disturbing was that the top C
            drama program on commercial television in 2013 was viewed by only 30,000 0-14 year
            olds. And&nbsp;<i>Lockie Leonard&nbsp;</i>, often spoken of in the same breath
            as&nbsp;<i>Round the Twist,&nbsp;</i>scored only 19,000 viewers and fewer than
            half that number were children 0-14. The overall numbers viewing these programs
            have dropped dramatically.

            For the Australian and Children's Screen Content Review to be
            informed about the value of P and C classified programs, ACMA really needs to
            get its research questions and policy issues sorted out better than this. It
            should report findings from any such research in terms of the age categories
            most relevant to quota regulation categories. Reports from ACMA should be
            consistent. The 2017 Research report reads like an exercise in obfuscation, as
            though no one who has any sense of the policy issues involved, is overseeing
            this research. The real trends in Australian children's TV viewing and kids'
            interest in quota programs get little clarification from this report. Their
            very absences from viewing patterns suggest the current regulated Australian
            programs have little relevance for children's viewing.
