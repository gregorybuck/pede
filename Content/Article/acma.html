    <p><strong>The Australian Communications and Media Authority's Children's Program Standards and Australian Content Standards</strong><br />
    (Patricia   Edgar, 2007)</p>
    <p>Section 122 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 requires  the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) to develop Standards  for children on commercial free-to-air television.&nbsp; The underlying policy rationale for  prescribing standards for children's television reflects the cultural  objectives for the role of broadcasting in Australia  as identified in the Act including to promote Australia's  identity, character and cultural diversity.&nbsp;  In legislating for the development of standards for children's  television the explanatory memorandum acknowledges that children's television  programming is a matter of community concern that may potentially be overlooked  by broadcasters as a result of their obligation to their shareholders to make  decisions which maximise profits.</p>
    <p>The objectives of the children's television standards  reflect cultural objectives and are identified as: </p>
    <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li>to       provide for children to be specifically catered for in programming,       including Australian programming and</li>
        <li>to provide for the protection of children from possible       harmful effects of television. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>In prescribing standards the Act explicitly identifies  several areas that are intended to be addressed in relation to children.&nbsp; These are: the times at which children's  programming should be broadcast; how programs televised during children's  viewing time should be classified; and the requirement for Australian  programming for children.</p>
    <p>The standards currently require commercial television  licencees to broadcast a minimum number of hours of both children's (C) and  preschool (P) classified programs referred to as C and P quotas.&nbsp; The C quota also includes a sub quota for  Australian children's drama programs. In order for these programs to qualify  towards the quotas they must be classified by ACMA before being broadcast.&nbsp; In addition to the requirements about  programming,&nbsp; the  Standards contain provisions relating to the broadcasting of advertisements,  promotions, station identifications, community service announcements, news  flashes and other announcements during C and P programming.</p>
    <p>ACMA's role is to work with the industry to manage an  effective regulatory environment that promotes self regulation, efficiency and  competition within the industry; is supportive of technological advancement;  and enables the industry to meet the needs of the community.</p>
    <p>The provisions of the standards must be adhered to as part  of the licence condition for commercial television broadcasters. There are  penalties if a licensee does not adhere.</p>
    <p>Additionally, licensees must adhere to the requirements of  the Australian Content Standard which provides a definition for Australian C  drama and&nbsp; requires  a licensee to broadcast a minimum number of hours per year of first release  Australian C drama.</p>
    <p>While the Standards place a positive obligation on the  industry in relation to children's programming there is also a commercial  television industry code of Practice - independent of ACMA's powers of  investigation - which caters for television viewing more broadly. The Code  covers issues such as program classification, including the portrayal of  violence, sex and nudity, language (swearing), drugs and suicide.&nbsp; The Code of Practice also requires that  television advertisements comply with the Australian Association of National  Advertisers code of ethics and code for advertising to children. The AANA codes  are self-regulatory tools, to ensure that advertisers meet their obligations to  the consumer and to promote a sense of social responsibility that ensures  appropriate content when advertising to children.</p>
    <p>These Standards are being reviewed to ensure they remain  effective as the future digital environment will be different from the current  analog environment, with multi-channelling and technological advancement likely  to significantly change the media landscape.</p>
    <p>The current requirements are as follows:<br />
        To provide children with access to programming that has been  developed specifically for them the Standards place an obligation on commercial  free-to-air television licensees to broadcast at least 390 hours of children's  programs per year, including 130 hours of P and&nbsp; 260 hours of C programs.</p>
    <p>Half of the C programs - 130 hours - must be first release  Australian content and all P programs must be Australian.&nbsp; The Standard also requires, in accordance  with the Australian Content Standard, minimum broadcast hours of Australian  drama within the overall quota of C programming required. </p>
    <p>Licensees must broadcast at least 96 hours of first release  Australian C drama over a three-year period with a minimum of 25 hours in each  year.&nbsp; At least eight hours per year of  repeat Australian drama is also required.</p>
    <p>Underpinning the quota requirements for children's  television is the objective of children having access to programs made  specifically for them including Australian programs, and the recognition that  there is little commercial incentive to broadcast children's programs.&nbsp; This recognition reflects the high cost of  children's programs compared with advertiser appeal. It is understood that  children's programs, especially quality children's drama, are no less expensive  to produce than similar programs for adults. &nbsp;However the child audience is smaller with  limited spending power and therefore less attractive to advertisers.</p>
