        font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>From 1978-84 I chaired the children's

        advertising standards were first introduced. I soon learned the only way to get
        program reform supported, and introduce the Cclassification for children's
        programs, was to go easy on advertising. </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
        font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Little seems to have changed. The
        advertising industry's reprieve this time is based on evidence from the
        Australian Communications and Media Authority, the current regulator, which has
        claimed it cannot identify a link between obesity and television advertising to
        children in its commissioned&nbsp;research. Ofcom, the media regulator in the
        UK, had no such problem in accepting as credible the research it commissioned
        and banned junk food advertising in and around children's television programs
        in 2007.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        The health industry and children's lobbyists who have fought tirelessly to
        protect the young from the welter of advertisements on youngsters' television
        promoting processed foods with high fat and sugar content, are understandably
        angry. But they do need to gather strength for a battle on a much broader
        front. <br>
        <br>
        The current regulatory and self-regulatory policy for children's advertising
        was based on research conducted in the 1970s. <br>
        <br>
        That concluded that children younger than 7-8 years lacked the cognitive
        ability to understand advertising's persuasive intent and could be enticed by
        people they admired -- hosts, celebrities, even cartoon characters -- to pester
        their parents to buy. <br>
        <br>
        These standards have been gloriously unsuccessful over the past two decades as
        the commercialisation of children has become a multi-billion-dollar industry
        and many loopholes around the rules have been exploited. <br>
        <br>
        Yet the big food and beverage advertisers, if they play it smart, will back off
        children's television and appear responsible because they know that is no
        longer where the biggest profits are. <br>
        <br>
        It's the digital marketplace, not television, where marketers are honing their
        targeting skills and salivating over the bonanza that is coming their way. <br>
        <br>
        The policy analysts at ACMA should look at the coming Journal of Adolescent
        Health in the US and the report on Interactive Food and Beverage Marketing:
        Targeting Adolescents in the Digital Age, by Kathryn Montgomery and Jeff
        Chester. <br>
        <br>
        The article draws together findings from 180 studies in recent years and
        describes the digital marketing strategies being used to track cyber-teens, the
        13-17 years group. <br>
        <br>
        New studies find adolescents are using social networks, instant messenger,
        interactive games, mobile phones and virtual three-dimensional environments to
        develop their peer relationships and come to terms with the age-old teenage
        dilemmas of sexuality and identity. <br>
        <br>
        New mobile marketing strategies using text messaging, electronic coupons, and
        video mobisodes, take advantage of young people's multi-tasking and constant
        connectivity through technology from broadband to instant messaging.
        Increasingly, mobile users will be receiving targeted electronic pitches, based
        on their personal profiles and actual street locations which they will have
        willingly supplied. <br>
        <br>
        Well over half of all online teens are creating content for the web. Marketing
        strategies are being designed to tap into the pool of young creative talent
        eager to offer their services for free to produce commercial spots for food
        companies sponsoring contests which entrants submit on YouTube, ensuring they
        will be seen by thousands of viewers. <br>
        <br>
        Google has introduced an algorithm that can predict which videos are about to
        go viral. The system then invites advertisers to target their ads specifically
        to those videos poised to become popular on YouTube. <br>
        <br>
        After an uncertain beginning followed by the tech crash, the interactive world
        is meshing well with the advertising community and working out where money can
        be made. <br>
        <br>
        Sound public policy is urgently needed to protect youth from increasingly
        invasive and manipulative marketing techniques which are certainly designed to
        influence their buying behaviour. Can anyone seriously believe there is no
        connection between advertising to young people and their obesity? <br>
