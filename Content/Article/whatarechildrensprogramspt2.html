            No Children's production industry in Australia can exist without
            a viable, film and television industry which must be sustained to tell
            Australian stories. That is a given. But what sits under that for children must
            be driven by children's needs.

            When done well, film and television programs can stimulate a
            child's imagination and open up the infinite opportunities that life presents.
            Like good books, good television programs can extend children's understanding
            of their world. Stories are particularly effective in helping children develop
            emotionally. That is why Australian and local programming is important for
            children. In 1980 television was the medium best suited to delivering these
            experiences to children. The media most suited today are the new media.

            Under the Children's Television Standards that have been in
            existence for more than 33 years a children's program is one which is made
            specifically for children or groups of children; is entertaining; is well
            produced using sufficient resources to ensure a high standard of the script,
            cast, direction, editing, shooting, sound and other production elements;
            enhances the child's understanding and experience; and is appropriate for
            Australian children.

            A number of very ordinary programs and programmes of dubious
            value for children have slipped through this quota net because of globalization
            and financial pressure on networks and producers. Animations made for a global
            audience have dominated the drama quota and much live action has been reduced
            to soaps. The need to have an international investor on board has compromised
            cultural integrity in some cases and allowed interference in the process. Such
            programming has become bland and conservative, or controlled creatively outside
            Australia. It cannot be claimed the regulations are now providing the rich
            experience intended when the CTS were designed and implemented.

            The networks initially insisted they could police themselves
            with self regulatory codes and they resisted all attempts to persuade them to
            confirm to guidelines, taking their objections as far as the High Court before
            legislation was passed that ensured stations could lose their licence if they
            did not meet regulated quotas. But the evidence has shown networks will not
            produce programs that meet the spirit of the standards and they insist existing
            quotas are one more reason they cannot compete in the global marketplace
            against players such as Google, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix.

            When I chaired the Advisory Committee on Program Standards for
            the Australian Broadcasting Control Board in 1975-6 we came up with an approach
            that we thought could work at that time. Programs were to be pre-classified by
            an expert committee before they went to air as suitable children's programs.
            They were to be shown at the same time across the networks to create an even
            playing field and broadcast at a time when children were available to be in the
            audience. The proposal was for one hour a week day 4.0 ' 5.0 pm with 30 minutes
            for preschoolers earlier in the day.

            In 1979 I began my tenure as Chair of the Children's Program
            Committee (CPC) of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) and given the
            task of drawing up the guidelines to implement the C and P classification
            scheme, much as was described in the 1976 Report. At that time, I undertook a
            study of children's responses (8-15) to children's television programs from the
            UK, USA and Canada that had not been seen in Australia before. The study, called
            The Unknown Audience, documented the fact that drama programs were more popular
            with this age group than any other form of program. Comedies were also popular,
            and the least favoured programs were magazine formats.

            The guidelines the committee drew up, defined the types of
            programs the CPC were calling for and emphasized the need for drama programs in
            the broad quota mix. But the programs the networks submitted for C
            classification were low cost studio-based game shows and magazine programs
            along with repeats of programs more than a decade old. (591 episodes of Lassie
            was one example) No original Australian drama was forthcoming until the CTS
            were implemented under new legislation, calling for a drama quota in 1984.

            Many advocates who supported the concept of children's programs
            were clearer about what they did not want than what they wanted. In the 70's
            and 80's Australian parents were still caught up in the fear that television's
            power to influence children adversely was such that, like the romantics of old,
            we should be protecting children from real life including, violence, sex and
            stereotypes. Such advocates wanted pro-social programs with characters who were
            positive role models.

            The Senate Standing Committee on Children and Television (1978)
            listened to submissions from advocacy groups and endorsed their concerns.
            During this decade, when calls for children's programming were at their peak,
            Australia's censorship rules were stringent and indeed galling to filmmakers
            working in our emerging industry. Australia was a very conservative country in
            the 60's and early 70's and books such as Norman Mailer's Why are we in
            Vietnam?, James Baldwin's Another Country, Barry Humphries' Barry McKenzie, Ian
            Fleming's The Spy who Loved Me, Phillip Roth's Portnoy's Complaint, as well as
            Mickey Spillane, Lolita and Lady Chatterly's Lover were banned. The Hollywood Motion
            Picture Production Code with its moral guidelines prevailed from 1930-68. The
            Code was wide-ranging resolving 'that special care be exercised in the manner
            in which subjects are treated, to the end that vulgarity and suggestiveness may
            be eliminated and that good taste may be emphasized': Concerns ranged from the
            use of the flag; attitudes toward public characters and institutions; men and
            women in bed together; the institution of marriage; sympathy for criminals;
            excessive or lustful kissing'. They are issues that would raise few if any
            concerns in 2017.

            There were few models of children's television programs to go by
            in 1970-80. In the post World War Two years, simple adventure stories became
            popular and censorship boards accepted such fare. Lassie Come Home was one
            example that spun off 7 feature films and 591 episodes of a series called
            Lassie made from 1954-73. It seemed you couldn't go wrong with animals so
            eighty-eight episodes of Flipper were produced from 1964-67 and ninety one
            episodes of Skippy from 1966-77. Adventure was a genre believed to be popular
            with children and Roger Mirams, a pioneering New Zealand film-maker produced a
            series of children's adventure series including, The Terrific Adventures of the
            Terrible Ten (1959), The Magic Boomerang (1965) and Funny Things Happen Down
            Under (1965). But after this burst of activity live action local drama gave way
            to re-runs of American sit-coms which took over the schedules. Because
            television sets had penetrated the Australian market, there was no need for the
            networks to bait parents to buy with promises of entertainment for children;
            the imported shows were very much cheaper.

            one was to extend the notions of genre typically associated with children's
            programs and the second was to delve more deeply into the child's secret world.
            I wanted to go beyond simple family and animal adventures, to tell Australian
            stories to children about their lives that reflected their social, cultural and
            emotional reality. Five years chairing the CPC convinced me the commercial
            networks would not make such stories and I believed briefing writers, to

            children.

            My first task as Director of the ACTF was an experiment in
            developing an anthology series, Winners, which would showcase diversity in
            children's drama and address contemporary issues children were experiencing
            growing up in the 80's. The series included contemporary, historical, fantasy,
            comedy, science-fiction and social-realism genres. They had male and female
            protagonists and children of different ages as actors, and I wanted to
            encourage reading and their use by teachers so all ACTF programs were accompanied
            by books and learning materials. Programs were designed to entertain but with
            an educational purpose at their core.

            Winners had to succeed; credibility for the ACTF was at stake. I
            called on the top creative people in the Australian film industry; the writers,
            directors, producers with a track record to work on this series. When the
            scripts were submitted to the CPC for approval, the committee did not want to
            approve them. I had spent five years chairing the ABT's Children's Program
            Committee, I was the major architect of both the C classification and had
            written the guidelines for the standards, so I could be forgiven for thinking
            that I understood their meaning and intention. But some Committee members
            thought the series did not conform to the CT Standards. Their feedback
            included: adult characters were 'put down', a character in a story cheated, the
            stories were not relevant to the age group (they were too old for them), kids
            wouldn't comprehend the issues raised, the stories were considered too emotionally
            dramatic. Most members came around to accepting the scripts in the end but one
            child advocate dissented, arguing Winners were not suitable programs for
            children. The Australian Film Commission and Film Victoria, from whom we were
            seeking funding, said the scripts weren't good enough. New South Wales invested
            and Winners did get made and the series proved to be a success. It won multiple
            national and international awards, sold into 75 countries and established a
            reputation for the Australian children's production industry.

            stories relevant to kids, the Director General of Education in Victoria read
            one of the books based on the script Just Friends, set in the western suburbs
            of Melbourne which dealt with low self esteem, teenage drinking and pregnancy.
            He sent a memo to all Victorian schools saying the book was not suitable for
            young readers because it used, 'the worst form of gutter language'. This
            amounted to 'pissed off', 'bitch' and 'shut up', rather typical teenage
            expressions at the time. The Winners books remained in print for more than 10
            years and sold 170,000 copies. The feedback from teachers using the series as a
            resource was overwhelmingly positive.

            Winners was a huge step forward for the children's production
            industry because, along with other quota programs produced, it raised the
            status of programming for children ' it was shown in prime time on the Ten
            Network ' it proved children would watch programs made for them, proved Australian
            children could act and that there was an international market as well as a
            domestic market for Australian children's programs. Unexpectedly, ACTF programs
            won a raft of awards overseas and international broadcasters began to look at
            Australia with new interest. Captain Johnno, a program in the second ACTF
            anthology series Touch the Sun (1988), made for the bicentennial year, won an
            International Emmy, only the second Emmy ever to be won by an Australian
            production.

            The success of Winners and Touch the Sun gave me confidence to
            try the next radical experiment. The second major shift I wanted to make was in
            exposing the world children really revelled in rather than the politically
            correct world the do-gooders wanted them to inhabit. This was an even tougher
            project. I searched for an idea that explored the underground culture of
            childhood. I aimed to produce a program that spoke to the unique larrikin
            Australian spirit, in our vernacular, with our sense of fun; the culture our
            children were growing up in. It took some months to identify what I thought
            might work.

            When I read Paul Jenning's short stories I knew he understood
            children. He had written a number of short, plot-driven tales that had a funny
            twist. There were no consistent characters or context but they made me laugh
            out loud and I thought here was something to work with. Paul Jennings had never
            written a script and knew nothing of the film industry, but I knew just the
            person to put him together with to design the series I was after. Esben Storm,
            a talented writer, director, actor and funny man, had worked on Winners and
            Touch the Sun and I knew he could work with Jennings and create on screen what
            I was after.

            Together they came up with Round the Twist. We took a year to
            develop the scripts, writing draft after draft as I searched for funding. I was
            told repeatedly this idea could not translate to the screen; the stories may be
            funny on the page but they would be visually disgusting. Eventually I persuaded
            Anna Home the Head of BBC Children's to acquire the series. That was the break
            that led to financing.&nbsp;

            The series, although idiosyncratically Australian, became, and
            remains, a hit with children from all over the world ' from Zimbabwe to Brazil,
            Japan to France. Round the Twist was made for Australian children but was the
            most commercially successful children's international program the Australian
            Film Finance Corporation funded in the decade; it was popular and acclaimed,
            and is still cited as a seminal program favored by almost all young Aussies. I
            rarely meet a young adult today who did not grow up with Round the Twist and
            regard it as a special program in their childhood. When it went to air in the
            UK it was a massive hit with the kids, but there were numerous adult complaints
            and The British Broadcasting Council sent a please explain letter to the BBC.

            The path to the child audience was one of obstacles. What I was
            endeavoring to do through ACTF programs was both to preserve the experience of
            childhood and its associated values of spontaneity, enthusiasm, humour,
            idealism, humanism , curiosity, imagination and adventure; to show the struggle
            involved in growing up and learning to make decisions; to show how to be
            resilient and resourceful. To delight but also document the environment and
            social situations in which children live today. And to show parents the
            pressures children face as well as those on themselves. Round the Twist proved
            it could be done. The debate about children's television has too often been
            dominated and misinformed by imagined concerns about negative effects and
            political correctness. The result leads to conformity rather than
            experimentation and programming that contributes little to children's needs.

            The debate has now been overtaken by changes in technology that
            raise a myriad of quite different issues and have reshaped the needs debate.
