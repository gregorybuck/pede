"inherit","serif";color:black'>After being assailed for the burdens we are
going to wreak on the economy by having the audacity to live longer lives, we
are now responsible for the problems facing the young. Economists are
prosecuting a campaign blaming old people for all the major social ills – the
high cost of housing, superannuation rorts, rising health costs, budget
deficits, now youth unemployment. Take for example Ross Gittins' column on
these pages last week titled&nbsp;<i>Young, unemployed and putting up with it</i>.
Such misguided and short-sighted talk builds on the ageist war touted by the
government in its recent Intergenerational Report which claims tomorrow's
workers won't be able to support us oldies. All this negative propaganda drives
a wedge between the generations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;background:
white;vertical-align:baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";
color:black'>Just who are all these &quot;oldies&quot; seemingly ripping off
the system? Are they the wealthy over-50s, or the poor over-50s? The home-owner
oldies or the oldies who have rented all their lives and have little to fall
back on as rents go up? The older, divorced singles or the old couples living
on a meagre pension? Are they those over retirement or pension age? Or the
over-80s whose medical costs are supposed to blow future budgets apart? Perhaps
they are the millions of people aged between 60-90 who do hours of volunteer
work for their community? Or the over 45s rejected by young human resource
managers as too old to even get an interview for a job?</span></p>

color:black'>The old are not an homogeneous group. They cannot be lumped
together as if they all have the same wealth, life experience or self-serving
attitudes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;background:
white;vertical-align:baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";
color:black'>Ross Gittins belies his own attack on the old by citing the real
reasons why many young people cannot find work. It's not because the old are
selfishly holding down jobs when employers cut back via &quot;natural
attrition&quot;. It's because technology and the shift from manufacturing to
services have taken out the traditional entry-level, relatively unskilled jobs
that early school-leavers were able to get. As the Brotherhood of St Laurence
figures show, it is failure to complete school or go on to further training
that explains high youth unemployment. The answer lies in improving the quality
of education and training, not in blaming the old.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;background:
white;vertical-align:baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";
color:black'>Casualisation of the workforce, resulting from competitive
globalisation, not self-interest by the old, lies at the heart of the problem.
Even the difficulty of new graduates in finding jobs reflects competition from
imported labour rather than a monopoly of the old staying on in available jobs.
Gittins mentions this but then slips into blaming the amorphous oldies, saying
&quot;Oldies seem convinced that the young's only problem is that they don't
want to work and so need to be starved back to the grindstone&quot;. Show us
any parent who &quot;lacks sympathy for youthful job seekers&quot;. Don't lump
us all in together and assume you know us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;background:
white;vertical-align:baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";
color:black'>The old are in fact parents, who have worked and saved, paid for
their kids' schooling, often helped them find a job, kept them at home until
well into their 20s and often helped them move into home ownership at the entry
level. The old are also grandparents who provide close to 80 per cent of all
child care. They include the growing number of people over age 60 still in the
paid workforce, taking less leave, being more reliable and productive than
younger inexperienced workers and thus keeping the so-called dependency ratio
at bay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;background:
white;vertical-align:baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";
color:black'>An increasing number of those over 65 say they want to stay
working longer rather than retire and the government is intent on making more
of them do so to lower the dependency ratio. Even here the figures are
misleading because, according to Professor Peter McDonald the ANU demographer,
by 2050 there will be two million more children younger than 10 years than it
was anticipated a decade ago. When they enter the workforce (provided the
government does its job, leading an economy that generates work opportunities)
the ratio of old to young will not be problematic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;background:
white;vertical-align:baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";
color:black'>The aged are not the main cause of rising health costs either. It
is the cost of new technologies and the overuse of tests and drugs that drive
up costs. The pharmaceutical industry sees a bonanza in old age for they treat
it as a disease. We need to move to a model that emphasises prevention and
well-being rather than take a drug for every ailment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;background:
white;vertical-align:baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";
color:black'>The real question to ask is not why do &quot;young voters cop this
cruddy deal so meekly?&quot;, but &quot;Why don't more older people speak up
against such stereotyped attacks on them?&quot; Ross Gittins should ask who
built Australia's economy so we enjoy one of the highest living standards in
the world; who is supporting young people through education and child-rearing;
who, by staying in productive employment, is keeping the dependency ratio low?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;background:
white;vertical-align:baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";
color:black'>Don't stereotype the old as a category but recognise diversity.
Stop the ageist attacks on us as a group. Develop a more positive approach to
ageing so that as we get older we can reinvent our lives and continue to
contribute to society as we always have.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;background:
white;vertical-align:baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";
color:black'>We don't want much. We want someone to love, somewhere to live,
somewhere to work and something to hope for. That is what young people want
too. So let's talk about love and intergenerational exchange. We have much to
contribute to each other. Is it beyond the wit of the government and the
economists to work that out?</span></p>
