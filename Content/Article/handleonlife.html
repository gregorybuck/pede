Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy (pictured below) lead a gang against Alan Alda, an
unscrupulous financier who has swindled the staff's pension funds in a Ponzi
scheme. The opening shot sets the tone, with the eyes of Benjamin Franklin in
close-up. We pull back to see a huge $100 bill on the bottom of Alda's swimming
pool on top of the tower where the staff plan to get their revenge.</span></p>

serious tale exposing the masters of the universe who packaged, repackaged and
sold billions of dollars in bonds (backed by subprime mortgages) until the
company's losses were greater than its total market capitalisation. Jeremy
Irons is CEO Dick Tulds - a not-so-subtle take on Richard Fulds - who directs
his analysts to dump worthless paper into the market at discount rates before
word gets out.</span></p>

style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>, first performed in 1963 but
set in 1934 following the crash that led to the Great Depression, is enjoying a
revival. Frank Langella (who portrayed Nixon in the&nbsp;</span><i><span

style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>&nbsp;drama) is riveting as
Gregor Antonescu (think Bernard Madoff today), a Romanian-born radio and oil
king. He is a man who would steal your socks without taking off your shoes and
you would admire his deftness. In watching Langella's performance, I thought
how brilliantly he could capture the failing Rupert Murdoch we saw face
questioning by the British parliamentary committee. The arts could be more
effective than the inquiry in conveying to the public the tale of corruption
and the toxic workplace culture at the&nbsp;</span><i><span style='font-size:

demise of the Murdoch empire will come in time. It is Shakespearean in scale:
an ageing patriarch, rifts in his dynasty, three wives, six children, the heir

Shakespeare's plays are still relevant for their depiction of corruption and
