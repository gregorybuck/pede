policy concerning the needs of families. John Howard was led astray. In
December 1988 as leader of the Federal opposition he launched his&nbsp;<i>Future

with two children, standing in front of a house (with a car) bordered by a
white picket fence. (Beaver Cleaver lived in such a house in the 50's and
