changed demographic patterns.&nbsp; It does social as well as individual damage
to undermine the confidence of elders by portraying them as a burden breaking
the economy; as stealing the livelihood and opportunities from those younger;
as having no value if not in the paid workforce. The familiar refrain runs on a
loop with little concern for elders beyond their economic impact. This is true
for the recent budget, yet so much could be achieved for little expenditure.</span>

        <span style='font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'>But good news has come from the ILOP Project
(Improving livability for older people in small towns), a modestly funded
initiative by the State Government of Victoria which has distributed $1.7
million (between 2011-2014) across 17 municipal councils to support positive
ageing projects. Ten thousand older people participated in 190 separate
projects defined by these local communities.</span>

        <span style='font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'>A Positive Ageing Calendar triggered my
interest in the Alpine Shire in North Eastern Victoria. Twenty three people
(the oldest 92) came together to portray the lead characters from iconic
Australian films. They hired fabulous costumes, engaged a professional
photographer, make up team and graphic designer to ensure a top quality
production. Then they became the characters in</span><span style='font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;<i>Picnic at Hanging Rock, Mad

they had in the cause of exhibiting the joys of positive ageing to the wider
community.</span>

        <span style='font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'>This ageing Alpine group has become The

attract: advisers, able, admirable, achievers, active, advocates, adventurous
and awesome.</span>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='line-height: normal'>
        <span style='font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"'>The A-Team has about 20 members. Meetings are
called regularly in different locations across the shire by a convener, Pat
Easterbrook, who has a great sense of humour and an informal style.&nbsp;
People will drive an hour or more each way to get there.</span>

    <p style='background: white'>
        <span style='font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black'>So why does it work? Respect is the quality that underpins
everything: for each other, for the ideas they discuss, develop, implement and
evaluate. People are given a genuine voice and they draw on one another's
strengths. All levels of management in the Shire are supportive of The A-Team's
role in creating a better experience for older people in a rural community.</span>

wheelchair in the Alpine Shire; provision of a hoist at the Bright Sport's
Centre to enable people with a disability to access the indoor swimming pool
all year round; the development of a photo library of older people in the
Shire, taken by seniors and on display in the Myrtleford Library; production of
mobility maps for the regional towns; production of the Positive Ageing
Directory of activities in the Alpine Shire; cooking classes and social
get-togethers such as High Tea classes; fitness and exercise programs; bench
seating for the Bright Art Gallery; development of the Victorian Seniors'
Festival in 2014 when they had a program of 22 events held over eight days
across the Shire attended by hundreds of people. The A-Team are now building on

        <span style='font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black'>The overriding contribution to the ILOP Projects' success is that
older people are the drivers, taking decisions that affect them and their
communities. &nbsp;So they feel empowered, engaged and motivated. As well, the
projects are collaborative with partners including local clubs and
organizations, health services, arts organizations, regional agencies and
others, allowing these groups to engage with older people.</span>

        <span style='font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black'>This process could be rolled out across Australia at modest cost.
It could only lead to positive effects in communities as residents, councils,
community agencies, businesses and organizations work in partnership to create
more inclusive and supportive communities thus giving purpose, reducing social
isolation and improving mental health for older people. Activity, not drugs, is
the key.</span>

    <p style='background: white; orphans: auto; text-align: start; widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; word-spacing: 0px'>
        <span style='font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black'>The next step would be to design inter-generational programs that
involve the young and the old, with schools participating in sustained
programs. We need to change attitudes across the generations and develop more
understanding perspectives, for the older generation is a resource for the
young and the young have much to offer their elders. &nbsp;The demographic
changes we are experiencing could lead to generation-friendly communities where
we are 'every age at once'.</span>
