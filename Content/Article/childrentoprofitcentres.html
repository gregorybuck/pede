<p><strong><u>Commercialisation: from children to  profit centres</u></strong><strong>. </strong><br />
    <strong>Patricia Edgar, Address to  Showcommotion, (Children&rsquo;s Media Conference), Sheffield  UK  July 2nd 2009 </strong></p>
<p>Over two  decades we have been thoroughly schooled in the core value of the western world  - we are born to consume. We eat too much, we drink too much, we want too much  and we spend more than we earn. Our lifestyle has brought the world ecomomy to  the brink of catastrophe, and although politicians around the world have  admitted to the failure of the deregulated marketplace, the only immediate  solution they can offer is to go shopping. </p>
<p>In this  commercial world the television programming we produce for children is the  major training ground teaching them to be acquisionists.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In March this  year, the British Government&rsquo;s chief scientific adviser Professor John  Beddington predicted global catastrophe by 2030 because the demand for food,  water and energy will exceed the supply. He predicts civil unrest and international  conflict. This man is clearly not a crank (1). </p>
<p>So as program  makers with the capacity and resources to mould children&rsquo;s thinking and  development what are we doing about this dire warning? What has been our  contribution to this crisis of consumption? &nbsp;Are we capable of imaginative new thinking to  enable children to be children once again, instead of the profit centres we  have turned them into? </p>
<p>20 years ago  children were not considered to be a profitable market. Programs were provided  by public broadcasters as a service to the community and by commercial  broadcasters as a result of regulation or the threat of regulation. This  changed with the advent of children's channels in the 90&rsquo;s and fierce  competition between them for market share. </p>
<p>While Disney  began marketing Mickey Mouse as far back as 1920s, it was the success of program  length commercials such as <em>He-Man and  Masters of the Universe, GI Joe: a Real American Hero, Care Bears</em> and <em>Strawberry Shortcake, </em>which entered the  children&rsquo;s program market in the early 80&rsquo;s, that set light bulbs off in the  minds of toy manufacturers and producers around the globe. The broadcasting,  toy and food industries conceived the idea of tie-ins to link their products promoting <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,  Transformers, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</em> and <em>Action Man. </em>All the industries involved boomed. </p>
<p>It wasn't  long before the public broadcasters, threatened by the Children&rsquo;s Channels  wanted their slice of the cake. In the late 90&rsquo;s along came <em>Barney </em>in the US, <em>Teletubbies</em> in the UK  and <em>Bananas in Pyjamas </em>from Australia<em>.</em> It was a revelation to public  broadcasters to discover there was money to be made from programs when  accompanied by a suite of merchandise. Children&rsquo;s television took on a whole  new meaning.</p>
<p>Marketers  took a closer look and over a few more years new profit centres were devised by  dividing the preschool and children's market&nbsp;  into four categories to exploit merchandising capabilities. We got baby  television and tweens. These categories were not developed because of  educational or child development needs they were purely market constructions invented  for the purpose of selling more programs and products </p>
<p>Babies do not  demand to be sat in front of television and there is no evidence that children  two years and under learn anything from television; indeed it may be that the  consequences for this age group are not neutral but negative. </p>
<p>Over the 15  year period that we have been flogging merchandise to the pre-school age group  researchers have learnt a great deal about child development.</p>
<p>The first few  years of life are a critical period for brain development and learning. Social  inequalities influence early learning. A nationwide study in the UK has found  that, by the age of three years, children from disadvantaged backgrounds are  already educationally, up to a year behind children from more privileged homes. </p>
<p>We know the  right kind of early childhood education programs can foster physical and  cognitive development as well as social and emotional development. Disadvantaged  children who have received high quality early childhood education are less  likely to need remedial education, less likely to become involved in crime, and  they earn more as adults. (2)</p>
<p>So it stands  to reason that pre-school television programs should be developed with care and  purpose from a well informed research base. Evidence suggests there would be a  substantial return to society from &nbsp;Government  investment in such programs. </p>
<p>Instead pre-schoolers,  including babies, who are among the heaviest viewers of  television in the community,  have led a marketing bonanza for the toy, food and character merchandising  industries at the expense of education and development. &nbsp;By  the age of 10, 78 per cent of children say they enjoy shopping. Research has  demonstrated that materialism in children is positively associated with  shopping and spending, and negatively associated with school performance.</p>
<p>The main purpose  of many of the programs is to teach young children character recognition, and of  course, to want toys and goods displaying the character they recognize. Parents,  who like to think their children are smart, get pleasure from their recognition  of a character and reward them. The marketing gurus know how to hit the right  spot.</p>
<p>The invention  of &lsquo;tweens&rsquo; ,pre-adolescents, 7/ 8 -12 year olds was another brilliant  marketing concept which cared nothing for the impact on the social development  of young girls and aimed to shrink the experience of childhood.&nbsp; Eight year olds have gone beyond a simple  interest in toys and character merchandising, so a whole new lifestyle needed  to be invented, built around commercial needs. </p>
<p>Young girls  were sexualized. Initially introduced to fashion and beauty aids by magazines  and reinforced by television advertising, the tween concept influenced the  stories in children&rsquo;s television drama and casting decisions.</p>
<p>Between five  and 10 years children hadn't thought too much about their gender. Boys played  with girls unselfconsciously, but &nbsp;magazines for tweens made sure children  understood their sexual destiny early. Clothes, shoes, cosmetics, dolls and  music were designed to create the illusion of a precocious, premature  sexuality. Miniature sexy thongs, lacy bras, the promotion of parties serving  miniature mocktails were designed to simulate sophisticated adult life.</p>
<p>The marketing  strategy that defined Tweens has worked brilliantly and 7-12 year old girls  have become conscious of their appearance, weight and what clothes they wear.  Tiny, bright, spindly, young things, who should be out playing chasey are now  worrying about what they look like and whether they fit in with their  peers.&nbsp; They aspire to have a brazilian  wax on their downy pubic hair, but still cry at night when they miss their mums  on a sleepover. </p>
<p>Gradually it  has emerged - and been well documented - that the blurring of childhood, by  leading kids into adolescence before they are emotionally ready has serious  risks. Eating disorders, self-harm and body image concerns are &lsquo;extremely  prevalent&rsquo; or &lsquo;well known&rsquo; in 85% of Australia&rsquo;s schools. (4) </p>
<p>Many girls  are struggling to understand appropriate sexual behaviour when images presented  to them are so precocious, and interestingly, there is now a decreased desire by  girls to participate in sport. </p>
<p>Boys do not  escape this pressure. They too are concerned about their body image. They are  bombarded by images designed to arouse. And just as girls can never be the  air-brushed fantasy on the glossy pages, no matter what they subject themselves  to, boys can never be that perfect, pumped-up poster boy hero.&nbsp; In this context there is an increase in  mental health problems and conduct disorders in boys -such as bullying and  fighting - and eating and emotional disorders -including phobias and depression  - in girls.</p>
<p>While physical  perfection is the standard media image, children have never been fatter.</p>
<p>Twenty per  cent of American, Australian and English children are overweight and ten per  cent are obese. These young people will battle illness for most of their lives  &ndash; type 2 diabetes, bone disease, respiratory and cardio-vascular diseases and  the hospital systems already over burdened will not cope. In Australia  studies put the cost of obesity in children and adults last year at $21 billion  dollars.</p>
<p>For the first  time in more than a century, life expectancy may fall with the real prospect  that parents may outlive their children.</p>
<p>Yet children  are targeted relentlessly by companies with marketing campaigns promoting fast  foods with high-fat, sugar and salt content linked with promotions for toys,  movies, television and film characters. Super sizing is common parlance. Shrek  promoted the &ldquo;Belly Bulge Combo&rdquo; &ndash; popcorn, coke and M&amp;Ms. </p>
<p>At a time  when our social and economic structures are crashing down, most Governments are  reacting with ambivalence to the issues affecting children, and most producers are  turning a blind eye to the potential health and social impacts of their  programs as they seek to retain funding for production. </p>
<p>Hasbro is  undeterred announcing in May a partnership with Discovery to launch a new US kids and  family cable Network to replace Discovery Kids to turn their toys into multi  media brands. Advocacy groups are frothing at the mouth while they await  product-placement infomercials as children&rsquo;s programs.</p>
<p>Most parents  are uneasy about the coarsening of the culture, the promotion of instant  gratification, the separation of sexuality from the intimacy. A recent American  survey ranked corruption in government and business, along with greed and  materialism as two of the three most important moral challenges facing the  nation - raising kids with the right values  ranked first.</p>
<p>But when for  fear of upsetting the electorate Govenments refuse to act, or fear of losing  the next deal and the desire to exploit an easy market are the drivers of our  programming decisions, is the challenge just too great? </p>
<p>What's  disturbing is the chasm between the magnitude of our challenges and the  smallness of our politics; the ease with which we are distracted by the appeal  of an easy market, our chronic avoidance of evidence and the tough decisions  required, our seeming inability to recognize the need to value childhood. </p>
<p>What is the  responsibility of the producer, the distributor, the broadcaster or media  operator at this time in this environment?</p>
<p>Have we so  degraded our children&rsquo;s television and sold out to commercialism, that neither  the industry nor the audience is capable of recovery?</p>
<p>Is there any  chance kids will generate correction themselves as they dessert television for  interactive media and spawn their own programs?</p>
