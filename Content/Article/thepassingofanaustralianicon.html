<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Gulumbu
Yunupingu passed away on May 10<sup>th</sup> in North East Arnhem Land. While
she will be remembered as an award winning artist for her bark paintings and
her majestic memorial poles - her work is part of the largest international
commission of contemporary indigenous art from Australia at the Musee du quai
Branly Paris - her achievements are many and her contribution to Australia has
been exceptional.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>The
older sister of Galarrwuy and  Mandawuy Yunupingu, both Australians of the year,
Ms Yunupingu was a power behind the scenes: an elder stateswoman, a leader and
teacher. She was a linguist, one of four translators of the Bible into the
Gumatj language over 26 years, and a qualified health worker and healer with a
deep knowledge of bush medicine and plant uses. She was a philosopher and progressive
thinker who dedicated her life to maintaining indigenous culture, while helping
young people bridge two cultures. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>I
first met Ms Yunupingu when I was Director of the Australian Children's
Television Foundation and committed to producing a feature film about young
indigenous Australians. Stephen Johnson had built a film company in the
Territory where he had shot the Yothu Yindi music video clips. Together we
developed a script with writer Chris Anastassiades called <i>Yolngu Boy</i> and
we needed permission from Galarrwuy Yunupingu, the leader of the Gumatj clan
nation, to work on a collaboration in Arnhem Land. I had tried unsuccessfully
for two years to contact Galarrwuy. For our plans to succeed I had to meet him.
We were advised to seek out Galarrwuy's elder sister Gulumbu to see if she
might help our cause. We sought out her daughter who took us to see her mother
who was involved in a funeral.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>The
ceremony was a striking scene on the red earth under the eucalypts. Ms
Yunupingu, her body painted with grey clay agreed she would come camping with
us to Birany Birany, on a remote bay some distance away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>We
stocked up on flour, steaks and sleeping bags and I sat with Ms Yunupingu as we
drove, but we were both shy so spoke little. When we arrived we settled on the
beach, lit a fire, barbecued the steak and talked about the film we wanted to
make until late in the evening. The film would tell the story of young people
caught between two worlds and the choices they were facing. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Ms
Yunupingu and I slept side by side on the beach that night. There were stars
across the sky but it was still a black night and I had no idea what was out
there. Next morning Gulumbu went to the edge of the water about eight metres
from where we had been sleeping and beckoned me. There was the imprint from a
very large crocodile which had sat watching as we slept. She decided to take me
hunting. Carrying a hessian bag and a stick she beckoned me to follow her into
the water close to where we had seen the crocodile imprint.  Terrified I
exclaimed, ‘What about the crocodiles?' She smiled and shook her head. I took a
deep breath and in I went up to my thighs. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Visible
on the sand underwater were dozens of crabs. Gulumbu collected a number then invited
me to follow her into the mangroves where the stalks were covered in oysters. She
gathered enough food for a feast then cooked the tastiest meal. We sat on the
ground beside a large midden under the shade. The heat was intense: I was
filthy, covered in salt, sunscreen, mosquito repellent and sweat and I enjoyed
the meal of my life - damper, crab and oysters. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>When
we returned to Yirrkala with no explanation we were called to a meeting with Galarrwuy
Yunupingu. It had taken two years but he confirmed the film would be made with
his cooperation. Then we sat on the ground with a group of women and Stephen
told the story of the script.  They laughed a lot and at the end Gulumbu pulled
me towards her to kiss me. I knew she trusted me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Our
contractual problems were difficult and ongoing, but in the background was a positive
force. On one occasion the director, my co-producer and I were called to take
part in a cleansing ceremony where Ms Yunupingu directed us to huddle over and breathe
in eucalyptus and other smells steaming from a pit in the ground. I took away
the feeling this was meant to rid us of animosities towards those causing
problems.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Filming
took place throughout 2000 and<i> Yolngu Boy</i> first screened on the Yirrkala
football oval to the people in the community who had been involved directly or
indirectly. The audience began to laugh  point and scream out with recognition
and delight as each actor they knew came up on the screen. They loved seeing
themselves and seeing their home. We had done what we promised to do in the
community and if that were to be the film's only achievement it was a powerful
one.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Ms
Yunupingu came with three other artists and her brother Galarrwuy to the launch
in Melbourne in 2001. When she was leaving she hugged me and sobbed. She knew
as I knew that the boys who took part in the film had gone through an
experience that they had clearly enjoyed and they had made their community
proud. The film was well received by those who saw it. Peter Thompson, the film
critic on Channel 9's <i>Sunday </i>program,<i> </i>said he wished he could
compel every Australian to see it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Ms
Yunupingu's art career took off after the filming of <i>Yolngu Boy</i> when she
won first prize in the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art
Awards with her piece entitled Garak- the Universe depicting the stars in the
sky. She has stated that her art is about the universe, and about every clan
and people of all colours in all corners of the world who can look up and see
the stars.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>When
I look at Ms Yunupingu's work I think of our night on the bay in Arnhem Land
under the stars. What a contribution she made to Australia. </span></p>
