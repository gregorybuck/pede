    This was not the Gillard with whom I was familiar. Why when a woman becomes
    prime minister should she think she is required to look different? Why should
    she change her style overnight? Gillard had not been elected because of her
    looks; she was supported regardless of this or her voice; they had become part
    of her appeal.</span></p>

    of her mouth. She sounded like a wound-up robot. Gone was the passion, the
    articulate intellect, the words demonstrating competence and vision. Out of
    this made-up image came bland, boring statements. She said nothing new, had no
    real vision for Australia. And what a disappointment that has been. The Gillard
