            <br/>'Tell me a story!' What
            child has not expressed those words? Children find the fantasy world a story
            transports them into, comforting, entertaining and enlightening. As a prelude
            to sleep stories allow them to dream the impossible. They explain the strong
            emotions children experience as they grow up, teach them about their tribe,
            their culture and their place in the world and give them a shared sense of
            purpose. Throughout human history, stories have been the glue that has civilized
            and bound people together in a community as humane beings. Stories stimulate
            our imagination, opening up the infinite opportunities that life presents.
            Developing imagination, Albert Einstein believed, was more important than
            imparting knowledge, as wondering is the basis of invention, of all development
            and understanding. It would be a dystopian world without stories.

            But stories have had different functions over the centuries and
            'children' have been variously defined and regarded. Western notions of
            childhood have changed dramatically, especially in the past 300 years, as has
            the way stories have been presented and enjoyed. The idea of childhood as a
            special stage of life is a relatively new middle-class phenomenon. Before the
            18th century children were seen as little adults, dressed as adults and
            expected to work like adults. They got no special consideration at law; until
            1780 over two hundred offences were punishable by hanging for children as well
            as adults. The youngest convict on the First Fleet was John Hudson, a
            nine-year-old chimney sweep who had been convicted of stealing clothes and a
            pistol. The reality of life for young children has been an economic, social and
            cultural construction over centuries.

            So, given the current Australian and Children's Screen Content
            Review, which is to determine the future of regulation for children's media
            content, it is important to ask some fundamental questions. Is childhood today
            a chronological stage or a system of constructed values? Has childhood changed
            since the Children's Television Standards (CTS) were introduced in the early
            1980's? Do we still mean the same thing when we talk about a children's program
            in 2017 as we did when quotas were implemented in 1984? And what special
            functions do such defined programs fill that warrant ongoing regulatory
            protection in a dramatically changing digital world?

            The rise of childhood can be traced back to the Reformation. The
            Puritans of the 17th Century were the first to stress the child's moral
            autonomy. They believed children had to be taught to think for themselves; to
            internalise moral values and to make choices for which they were personally
            responsible so they supported the need for education.

            During The Age of Enlightenment, in 1762, Rousseau published his
            treatise on education, Emile, arguing his theory of the innocence of childhood.
            Liberal and permissive attitudes to children began to take root, but the ideals
            of the time didn't match social practice. Rousseau left his five illegitimate
            children in foundling homes. 'Woman is especially made for man's delight', he
            wrote, and 'for that reason there is no need even to teach girls to write'.

            By 1830, despite calls for education, half Britain's workforce
            in the cotton mills was child labor. The English Factory Act of 1833 limited
            child labor to 8 hours a day, but because adults argued for the same terms, the
            limit remained at 10 hours. Child exploitation only came to an end with the
            passing of The Education Act of 1870, which required children up to the age of
            10 to attend school. It was a start toward the protection of the youngest in
            society, but it was also because factory owners needed more literate workers
            who could read instructions for using machinery safely and efficiently. Many
            needy parents protested and absenteeism from school was common.

            The poor continued to be exploited while the children of the
            affluent middle-class were shipped off to boarding schools, separated from
            adults and sheltered from the real world. But by the late 19th century,
            following the industrial revolution, in Australia as well as Britain, growing
            economic demand for an educated and relatively healthy workforce had produced
            education for all, and altered the nature of childhood.

            In the pre-industrial age stories were told by bards orally and
            the experience was shared by all ages. The stories, although often cautionary
            tales, were told uncensored. Fairy tales were not about beautiful princesses in
            gauzy dresses but 'about child murder, cannibalism, starvation, deformity,
            desperate human creatures cast in the form of beasts, or chained by spells, or

            Such stories enabled people to indulge their lust for sadism;
            evil was omnipresent but good triumphed. Characters were simplified and
            polarized to promote understanding among the uneducated; the good were
            beautiful, the evil were ugly. The overriding message of such stories was that
            life is a struggle against severe difficulties; they are unavoidable but if you
            are steadfast in meeting unexpected and unjust hardships, obstacles can be
            overcome and mastered. They were valuable life lessons for adults and children.&nbsp;

            This oral form of group entertainment disappeared when the
            printing press was invented and children were sent to school and separated from
            their parents. As they were taught to read, their stories became simpler and
            more didactic. The long-accepted and traditional elements in stories were
            squeezed out of the official child culture to protect children from knowing
            about the murder and mayhem and horrors of life that might 'disturb' them.
            Stories acquired taste; they began to taste childish. Humanists taught courtly
            behavior. Religious reformers did not see the need for anything but religious
            reading. If children wanted adventure it could be found in the bible. Both
            groups agreed the 'chapbooks' (akin to comics) were harmful for children. This
            developing storybook culture no longer reflected the needs of children in a
            shared community; it reflected the needs and values of middle-class parents and
            teachers who expected to train well-behaved children to be seen but not heard.
            Emotionally, children were cast adrift to deal with their inner impulses and
            feelings.

            Human enterprise seizes opportunity and in the early eighteenth
            century it was discovered money could be made from a children's publishing
            industry. The Arabian Nights (1706) and Mother Goose (1760's) a compilation of
            nursery rhymes appeared. Grimm's Fairy Tales (1812) were considered too grim
            for children. Swiss Family Robinson (1812) was basically a religious work.
            Alice in Wonderland (1865) a fanciful tale and Tom Thumb's Pretty Song Book
            (1744) a book of nursery rhymes, emerged along with others by liberal minded
            authors who brought new themes and attitudes to children's books. The toy
            industry also took off and experts were beginning to complain that toys had
            become so elaborate they left nothing to the child's imagination. The seeds of
            the debates that have raged about children's entertainment since were sown.

            The dominant philosophical notion put forward by child advocates
            was that of childhood vulnerability and their need for protection from the
            secrets of adult life for as long as possible. One of the contradictions of
            this history is that the glorification of childhood coincided with the greatest
            exploitation of children. In literature and art the romantics were exalting the
            purity and innocence of childhood while at the same time the family and the
            church, which should have been responsible for nurturing children, were agents
            of repression.

            The industrial revolution in the 19th century led to children
            serving as unskilled labor on the production line in the mills, as chimney
            sweeps, as pick-pockets, as well as lace makers. Eight year old girls dragged
            coal trucks through wet tunnels on their hands and knees. Charles Dickens wrote
            a stream of novels exposing the plight of working-class poor and abandoned
            children. But it would be another century before changes in industrial policy,
            education, social and welfare reform, a greater knowledge of child development
            and appreciation of individual differences, would lead to childhood being seen,
            as it is today, as a stage with special needs. When these changes came they
            were driven as much by economic need as concern for the well-being of children.

            But it would become apparent, despite the repression of the
            Victorian Age, that children could not be coerced into becoming models of
            conformity. They simply did not fit a narrow stereotype. The nineteenth
            century's effort to standardize childhood through schooling failed. It would be
            some time before it was understood that the purpose of education should be to
            awaken a child's mind. Such a debate about the purpose of education and

            Charles Darwin was the first to keep systematic notes on one of
            his children to study child development and by 1900 child experts began to
            emerge and their theories split along several lines. Studies looking at the
            differences between children found a range of abilities. Behaviorism was one
            branch that aimed at conditioning children and molding them to a teacher's or
            parent's will. The French Psychologist Jean Piaget insisted children developed
            in stages, each step building on previous capacities toward mastery over their
            world. Research that followed called this 'stage theory' too rigid and
            arbitrary.

            confidence among many child-rearing experts, parents and teachers, about how
            best to rear children. Neither parents nor the wider society are offering
            children the clear guidance they need and want. There are those who argue that
            children must be protected and socialized, taught moral values and know their

            desire for their child's constant happiness and success drives many parents to

            from the post war years when most people married and had children and the roles
            of men, women and children were more clearly delineated. These changes have led
            to a different experience of childhood. Education, equality for women, the cost
            of living, work demands and sexual liberation have altered family life. Women
            are less prepared to accept the role of dependent housewife and the dual income
            family has to organize its time differently.

            Neil Postman claimed technology, starting with the invention of

            Initially television broke down the pattern that had occurred
            across the 18th and 19th centuries of separating children from adults for their
            entertainment, as most houses did not acquire multiple sets. Through television
            children once again got to know the adult world for what it is but they were
            not participants in this world. The stories they saw rarely integrated
            children. But it became clear television could tell stories that clarified life
            and give, in pictures as well as words, an understanding of the joys and
            frustrations children encounter. All around the western world people debated
            how television should be used for the benefit of children and what types of
            stories we should tell them via the medium.

            At first such story telling was seen as the responsibility of
            broadcasters, who once they were assigned a licence and television sets had
            been adopted widely throughout Australia, were reluctant to spend resources on
            what they saw as a minority market. Regulations were enshrined and for more
            than a decade children's production flourished with subsidy from governments
            and quotas placed on broadcasters. Even so there was still disagreement among
            teachers, child psychologists, writers and television producers about what was desirable
            children's programming. Then in the 90's cable television disrupted the market
            bringing international children's channels with the realization there was money
            to be made from branded character-based programming screened all day.

            Competition changed the nature of quota programming which had to
            earn overseas sales in the global marketplace. The conflicting views among the
            story-telling industry stakeholders that followed and are current are not
            dissimilar from positions espoused over the last two hundred years. The
            difference is, media companies are now big businesses and children are big
            business. In this climate do we still try to target, isolate and 'protect'
            children or do we expose them to programming made for the mass market? What
            needs do we try to fulfill when commercial broadcasters have demonstrated
            clearly if they are required by regulation to schedule children's programming
            there is no way known they will meet the spirit of those regulations.

            Creating children's stories in any medium is tough work, not
            because the production demands are greater than with most entertainment for
            adults, but because there is so much humbug surrounding so many issues that
            relate to children. Although we understand child development much more than we
            did when the romantics first emerged they are still around. They seem to have
            completely forgotten how they felt as children. They remember only the good
            things about their childhood and block out the unpleasant, the traumatic and
            the naughty and fearsome villains, whom they believe do harm to children. They
            may know the world is a tough place but they would like children's programs to

            don't see the homeless or victims of child abuse they don't exist. They would

            Fundamentally every child deserves the best chance to develop
            her full potential. Media for children have an important role to play in this
            regard in remedying the provision of early childhood education. We now know that
            a child' s brain cells make connections at an astonishing rate and the strength
            of those connections depends on what they are exposed to, how frequently they
            are used and reinforced and how others respond to and guide their efforts to
            understand. The first four years ' from conception to age three ' are the most
            critical period of human development. The brain is at its most absorbent and
            every child can learn to walk, to talk, and to work out how to fit into the
            family and the wider society if it is given experiences that help them master
            those important skills. If children are not encouraged to use a skill they will
            lose it.

            Accessible, early childhood education, is vital to all young
            children. Australia has lagged behind the OECD average for industrialized
            nations in the provision of early education until very recently. We now have
            90% of four year olds who receive 15 hours a week of early education, (they
            would watch television longer) but this program is funded only up to 2018. We
            have only 68% of three year olds receiving education which is a provision well
            below the OECD average and because market considerations dominate what should
            be an essential service, child-care workers are paid poorly. Given we know how
            important brain development is at this stage, for later life opportunities and
            success, we cannot afford to continue to regard programming for this age group
            as simply entertainment and time-filler.

            The benefits that flow to pre-schoolers from good storytelling
            are many. Parents who understand this will read to their kids daily from the
            first year. If you cannot read, then you are handicapped for life. One of the
            most important teaching tasks in the early years is to engender a love of
            reading through well-chosen stories that will introduce children to the private
            pleasure of a rich fantasy world and motivate them to want to visit that world
            on their own. When children develop an interest in reading they will acquire
