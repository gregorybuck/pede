      <p class=MsoNormal>Children can’t escape violent and sexual imagery. My
      seven-year-old grandson enquired recently: “What’s longer lasting sex, Mum?”
      They witness stories and images about death and violence on the streets of
      Melbourne, the war in Iraq, the Mumbai massacre, and destruction by
      bushfires. </p>
      <p class=MsoNormal>By the time children enter preschool they have already
      been thoroughly schooled by media.  A third of three to four-year-olds watch
      television for more than nine hours per week.  Another third are watching
      four-and-half hours.  When mum is home they are watching more television, not
      less. Many teachers are suspicious of television and hold a general belief
      that the medium generates violence and anti-social behaviour with little
      positive value to offer. But the reality is far more complex.</p>
      <p class=MsoNormal>For most of my career I have argued for the teaching of
      media courses in schools and the use of film and television as a resource to
      assist the development of children. I taught the first university courses to
      be offered on film and television in Australia while I was teaching at La
      Trobe University in the 1970s. </p>
      <p class=MsoNormal>Schools continue to be regarded as the place where
      children go to learn, while media are still regarded purely as a source of
      entertainment. Such separation means the content of media is not recognised
      as the wonderful resource for education that it is and education is not seen
      as a remedy to counter the excesses of media. This attitude has been changing
      slowly but not enough to keep pace with the convergence of television,
      computing and mobile telephony and the increasingly dominant role media are
      playing in children’s lives today.</p>
      <p class=MsoNormal>Most importantly, the evidence for the negative effects of
      television on children has never been clear-cut. I have studied the research
      literature around the effects of media and have investigated young
      perceptions of programs by interviewing children after they viewed films of
      many different genres. What my research and others’ makes clear is that it is
      the context of violence, not the nature or the extent of violence, that is
      important to children. What disturbs children is something that relates to
      their own experience and that can differ for each child. Children interpret
      film and television content differently from adults and they believe the
      nightly news, and programs that look like the news, whether they are fiction
      or documentary fact.</p>
      <p class=MsoNormal>The best research makes clear that many factors come into
      play in influencing children’s behaviour before the impact of media. These
      include such things as social isolation, conflict with parents, poor school
      performance and lack of opportunity. When these conditions apply, media use
      becomes a substitute for life experience and a further influence on child
      behaviour. </p>
      <p class=MsoNormal>An isolated child who views many hours of television will
      have a different perception of social behaviour than a child mixing with
      friends who watches fewer, but maybe the same types of programs. A child who
      grows up in a home where he sees his father abuse his mother is more likely
      to be violent as an adult than one who grows up in a stable loving home,
      whether they play violent video games or not.</p>
      <p class=MsoNormal>This does not mean that the media have a reduced
      responsibility to clean up their excesses and provide the programming
      children need for positive emotional and intellectual development – quite the
      contrary. We squander a precious opportunity when we fail to capitalise on
      the seductive power that media have for children and demand better
      programming to assist educational development.   </p>
      <p class=MsoNormal>Programs that are very popular with children such as The
      Simpsons and South Park are often criticised for their anti-social content, but
      these programs are insightful and provide rich material for classroom
      discussion of social issues, family life or ethical issues relating to the
      use of language, racism and violence. Teachers should be able to speak about
      such issues with the children they teach and to do so effectively they need
      to understand how the media work.</p>
      <p class=MsoNormal>Media are an unavoidable part of family life and learning
      throughout all the schooling years and are becoming more pervasive than ever.
      Like it or not, the media is a rival seat of learning for kids which teachers
      need to take into account. For this reason, the calls to protect children
      from media are completely unrealistic. </p>
      <p class=MsoNormal>Improving content is the key and teaching media literacy
      is crucial. Within the school curriculum children need to learn how to
      access, understand and control technology as a core part of human competence
      in the modern world.  They need to learn how to discriminate; how to study
      media advertising to evaluate techniques of persuasion; the reliability of
      information versus opinion and how to manage emotional responses to violence,
      sex and news. </p>
      <p class=MsoNormal>The way forward in our information society is not
      prohibition but to regulate content, demand quality programming, utilise
      media in schools, teach media literacy and guide children to self-regulate
      their media use effectiely. </p>
