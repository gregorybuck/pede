    <p><strong>Meaningful participation – how to give the community a 'voice'</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Don   Edgar</strong><strong></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Department for  Community Development, </strong><strong>Perth</strong><strong>,  June, 2003</strong><br />
        <strong>_______________________________________________________________________</strong></p>
    <p>I have spent my entire life being involved in community  activity and arguing for more involvement in government by the wider community.</p>
    <p>When people say to me, but <u>how</u> do you get people  involved, I have to go back to basics. </p>
    <p>I am often told, 'people don't want to be involved', 'people  are too busy these days', 'it always ends up with a few noisy ones dominating  and the ordinary people left out', 'it's a middle class activity, you won't get  anything from this lot'. And I have to say, 'Yes, it's not easy', but also  'Maybe you're expecting too much, or expecting the wrong things, because you  have a middle class view of what real participation is.' </p>
    <p>But we cannot begin to talk about community participation  without first setting the context.</p>
    <p><strong>Why do we need a  change?</strong></p>
    <p>Australia  sits in a rapidly changing world and life is ever more complex. It is a world  in part hostile to local communities because it is driven by a new form of  'turbo-capitalism' that doesn't give a damn about local jobs, or family life,  or even the viability of the Australian (let alone State or regional) economy  and culture. To my mind, that makes government (especially at State and local  level) more, not less important. But it needs to be more intelligent  government, one that is more responsive to the complex 'patchwork' of regions  and localities with different resources, needs and interests that go to make up  this 'Patchwork Nation'.</p>
    <p>Complexity means one-size-fits-all will no longer work. We  cannot have top-down services delivered to every patch in the same way,  designed by people who don't know how diverse community needs are and don't  care. The whole culture of the public service needs to be outward-, not  inward-looking and we need new structures and processes that will break down  the silos, build the capacity of communities to do things for themselves, in  their own way, and put an end to the mentality of 'servicing'. There is a need  to shift the power of decision-making, away from central managers and planners,  to real communities where democracy and the civil society are re-built and democracy  is 'thickened'.</p>
    <p>We also have to assert a few principles. </p>
    <p>First, people have a right to be involved in any decisions  that will affect their everyday lives. We live in a democracy, not a  dictatorship, and though, of necessity, we delegate a lot of decision-making  authority to elected representatives, officials and experts, that does not give  them carte blanche to determine what is best for us or how best to achieve the  common good. Unfortunately, the culture of the public sector – by which I mean  not just government public servants, but also the non-government community  service agencies – is not always accepting of this right or structured in such  a way as to guarantee I have a say in the many decisions that affect my life.</p>
    <p>Just think about the practice of medicine. We often complain  about doctors and their arrogance, their sense of superiority to us as  patients. However, if I go to a doctor and he finds I have cancer, the first  right I have as a patient is to be informed – about the diagnosis, about the  likely course of the disease, about forms of treatment and ways of managing the  consequences of that treatment. He can't simply order me to have an operation,  or chemotherapy, or some alternative treatment he may prefer. It's my body, and  I decide what can be done to it. Of course, I'll listen to his expert opinion,  but I may seek a referral to a specialist or two to add to my information base.</p>
    <p>I can only act on the basis of good information and access  to good information is the first requirement for any form of community  participation. </p>
    <p>Next, I will discuss my options with several others –  partner, family, friends, those who have been through a similar experience. In  other words, I will network, put the pieces together, draw on a range of other  resources to help me make a decision but (more importantly) to support me  through the crisis and eventual treatment. </p>
    <p>So the second requirement for participation is access to an  appropriate network – preferably to many inter-locking networks which will  together give me a 20/20 picture of where the problem sits and what can be done  about it.</p>
    <p>But both these steps in the participation process assume  something else.</p>
    <p>First, that I have the ability to seek out and to understand  relevant information. If I am poorly educated, non-English-speaking, cannot  read, do not have access to a telephone or the Internet, my ability to  participate in any meaningful way is limited – I'm likely to just accept what I  am told to do and I am a victim of my own ignorance.</p>
    <p>Second, it assumes I have a family, some friends, a network  or two that will expand my resources and ability to decide what is best. But if  I am newly arrived in this neighborhood, or ostracized because of my culture or  some disability, or confined to my home because of unemployment, poverty or  caring responsibilities, then networking, checking things out with others, is  hard to do. Isolation is the enemy of active participation.</p>
    <p>Third, it implies that I have a 'voice', an ability to ask  questions, challenge what I am told, to think for myself, weigh up the options  and make an intelligent choice about what to do. And having a 'voice' is not  enough unless other people 'listen', and listening (or, more importantly,  'hearing' what other people say, paying attention to it) is in short supply.  Because we all speak and hear in different voices – our vocabulary may be  limited, our questions may be vague, our ethnicity and language may limit how  and what we ask, we may defer to or be expected to defer to 'expert' opinion,  and many of us have had our 'voice' so stifled in the past by authoritarian  parents, teachers, bosses and bureaucrats that it's more of a whisper than a  shout.</p>
    <p>That means the third requirement for participation is a  listening context, a culture within the public service and within community  organizations and workplaces which respects my peculiar voice and the diverse  peculiarities of the voices of others. It cannot be a culture of disdain, of  disrespect, of superiority. It must be one in which 'the way we do things  around here' is listen actively to what we are being told by other people.</p>
    <p>If I go back to my example of medicine and having cancer,  there is another requirement before I can actively participate in the  decision-making that will affect my life. That's money and/or control over how  money will be spent in my treatment. </p>
    <p>If I have private health insurance, I can shop around, seek  other expert opinion, have the surgeon of my choice, in the hospital of my  choice, at the time of my choosing. On the other hand, if I am poor, dependent  on bulk-billing, Medicare and public hospitals, you could hardly say I have  much chance of deciding how I will be treated. Look at all those poor people  with terrible teeth who line up at the Dental Hospitals, having waited a few  years to get fillings or a set of false teeth. Resources, and control over  those resources, are vital to any form of participation.</p>
    <p>To summarise what we've covered so far :</p>
    <p><strong>Involvement depends  upon?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Information –    availability?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ability to use?<br />
        'voice'</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Networking</li>
        <li>A listening culture</li>
        <li>Control over resources</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now, let's go beyond the example of a private individual in  need of medical treatment. Let's look at the so-called community as a whole and  how we might best engage them in real participation.</p>
    <p>At the wider community level, there are many barriers to  public participation, and we have to be realistic about them.</p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;Main barriers to engagement?</strong></p>
    <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li>time       – both parents working/studying (Govt. and employers can give paid time       off if they wanted to)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>- times of meetings often do not  take into account parents' situation</p>
    <ol start="2" type="1">
        <li>logistical       – transport, language issues, length of the family's stay in the local       area</li>
        <li>attitudinal       and cultural differences – re. child-rearing and communication styles –       often derive from parents' own negative experiences of schooling</li>
        <li>lack       of training of staff in how to build trusting, collaborative relationships       with parents – time and frequency is often less important than the quality       of the relationship with staff whenever they meet</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The first step is to define exactly what is the community.  If you start with the notion that community is one thing, you'll never get it  right. There are always many different communities within any defined 'place'.  Your best starting point is a 'place' where people have some interests in  common. But that won't include everyone in that place. You have to start by  doing a stakeholder analysis – who is/will be affected, and how? There's not  much point in trying to engage the whole 'community' in every issue – they're not  interested, don't have time, and you'll be doomed to fail.</p>
    <p>Obviously, if you work with child care your first community  is the community with the biggest vested interest – parents. You won't have  much trouble engaging parents in decision-making about the child care  curriculum, physical facilities, management structures. But how might you  engage those not so directly interested, though vital to doing your work well?  e.g. employers who won't give parents time off to participate in the centre or  kindergarten? Or the grandparents who do most of the child-minding outside  formal hours of care? Or the maternal child health nurse, family support  worker, child protection officer, primary school teacher whose work supplements  and complements your own? How do you draw in resources outside your own comfort  zone that might make your job easier, improve the outcomes you are trying to  achieve?</p>
    <p>The answer again has to be pragmatic, practical, not overly  grand. Start with the networks and connections that already exist. If the issue  is children's and family services, then child care workers, disability workers,  maternal and child health nurses, primary school teachers probably already talk  to one another, at least have a common framework of concern for the wellbeing  of children. Or if the issue is youth, then school teachers, parents, sports  groups, police, etc. will form a common interest group. </p>
    <p>But they may have no organized means of networking, of  sharing information, getting together to exchange information. And you can  develop those networks in very informal ways – lunchtime paper bag chats, at  different venues; rotation dinners at one another's homes; swapping duties with  some so they see how the others work and the problems they face; shared  administration for staff recruitment, buying of supplies, sorting applications  for and assignment of child care places. You don't always have to have  meetings, or conferences, or public forums.</p>
    <p>Especially with parents or clients, it's often better to  start small – with home visits one-on-one, helping small groups of parents to  get together, not just in play groups, but in parks or playgrounds, McDonalds  or other shopping centres, with a clear purpose – to examine how suitable they  are for children, work out what is missing, what they would like their children  to experience, how things might be improved. They can be given a simple  check-list of 'child-friendly' or 'family-friendly' characteristics, to be used  as a stimulus to discussion – 'voice' – and as a starting point for active  participation.</p>
    <p>But you need to think first about what 'participation' means  – it's not just one thing; there are several levels of engagement and all can  be legitimate things to aim for.</p>
    <p>Another way of putting this is to say there are four main  levels of participation or engagement:</p>
    <p>It is always important to make clear, at the outset, what  level of participation is possible, what is being asked for, what people can  realistically expect. Otherwise, expectations are raised too high, the  community finds it has little influence and no real power, and distrust and  cynicism set in, making any future participation even less likely.</p>
    <p>Let me give you some examples of how community participation  can work, and the processes involved. These are drawn first from my own  experience, then I will mention some models from overseas that we might think  of adapting to conditions in Australia.  None of it is easy.</p>
    <p>The key was to insist that area communities identify  'resources', not just 'needs'. At first, they denied they had any resources,  but when we asked what skills people had, what special knowledge, what tools,  facilities, musical instruments, arts materials, etc. they had, they could see  a wealth of resources to build on. Those artificially-defined 'areas' did  become communities, and the programs and morale they developed for themselves  continue to this day, some twenty years later.</p>
    <p>The New Links Workplace idea grew out of my work with  companies wanting to become more 'family-friendly'. I decided that no matter  how good their internal policies were, if the communities in which their  employees lived were not supportive of family life, the company's efforts would  be thwarted. So we got them to do a 'Community Scan' of existing family support  services, gaps, needs, and then to act politically to improve them. Alcoa,   Australia Post, Lend  Lease and others were thus able to forge new links with local government,  schools, and family support agencies, bringing them in to the workplace to  operate in more immediate ways. They also lobbied for better child care, aged  care and youth facilities across their communities, thus improving the  'family-friendliness' not only of their work sites but also for the entire  town/region.</p>
    <p>In both these examples, the essence of the process was listening  – giving people a 'voice' through questionnaires, focus groups, information  dissemination and exchange, using information as a means of changing the  culture, changing the way people were thinking, so that new, more participatory  mechanisms could be set up. Both of them involved not just talking about needs  and gaps, and what people wanted done for them, but also talking about  resources, the skills and ideas, physical and people resources that could be  built on. </p>
    <p>And in both cases, the amount of money needed to improve  matters turned out to be much less that anyone had expected. Greater  efficiency, transparency and accountability were the result, and, most of all,  the outcomes were obvious and were measured, not just the 'inputs' and  'outputs' of the usual bureaucratic kind.</p>
    <p>Successful methods of consultation and community involvement  are therefore not just the traditional ones of setting up committees and having  public meetings. As I hope I've illustrated, communities have significant  knowledge resources and they are too often untapped. So you have to look beyond  the old formalities. In fact, public meetings are not the most effective way to  involve people. The most effective way is to give them a task to do, preferably  one that is straightforward and simple, not too demanding of time, and one  which makes them see their problems in a new light, one that is shared and  might be met by sharing resources, not simply demanding more of the same. In  doing so, you empower them and give them 'voice'.</p>
    <p><strong>Methods of  consultation?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <ul>
        <li>Look beyond traditional c'tees and public  meetings</li>
        <li>Identify the community's on untapped  knowledge/resources</li>
        <li>Simple rather than complex</li>
        <li>Start where they are, not where you are</li>
        <li>Use their venues, not yours – give the excluded  a 'voice'</li>
        <li>Set a clear time-frame – Stage 1 open-ended  Stage 2 – specific purpose</li>
        <li>Expect the unexpected, will be difficult, adapt  as you go along</li>
        <li>Focus groups – find what's important, open-ended  but with clear issues</li>
        <li>Workshops – use mind maps, scenario-building,  visioning, storyboarding, open-space caf&#233;, passion caf&#233;</li>
        <li>Area/neighborhood Forums – meet regularly on  defined issues</li>
        <li>Open house Roadshows/exhibitions – go to people,  get reactions</li>
        <li>Information Hotline</li>
        <li>Representative groups – capitalize on existing  networks, feedback</li>
        <li>Q'res and Surveys – costly, may not tell you  'why' feel that way</li>
        <li>Deliberative opinion polls – only get Yes/No</li>
        <li>Advisory C'tees – need to be representative,  accountable</li>
        <li>Design Meetings/Charettes – post-it notes,  relies less on literacy \</li>
        <li>Accept but manage conflict</li>
        <li>Promote dialogue, not monologue</li>
        <li>Use 'we' talk, not 'us' vs 'them'</li>
        <li>Ask what worked, what didn't, and why</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>The key is 'active listening', where the professionals  empathise and accept people's feelings, show patience and respect. Avoiding  jargon, body language that reveals disdain or discomfort, using their venues,  not your own, talking first with those most closely involved with an issue,  expecting, accepting but managing conflict so you don't fuel divisions and  instead build on areas of agreement and mutual interest, promoting 'we' talk,  not 'us' versus 'them', asking what worked in the past and why/why not,  promoting dialogue, not monologue are all crucial techniques.</p>
    <p>They can be learned, and the message for government trying  to devolve, to consult, to engage communities in the way public money is spent  on services, is that they have to train their workers, not simply throw them to  the wolves and expect them to know how to engage the community in such  processes. </p>
    <p>Let me finish by listing a set of new principles for a new  public service culture, principles that embody what I have tried to illustrate  today:</p>
    <p><strong>Examples of real  involvement?</strong></p>
    <p>Italy,  Netherlands, Portugal  – parents control ECEC staffing and budgets – new partnerships</p>
    <p>Netherlands – 'broad-based schools' to access the whole  range of children's services – grew from the bottom up, wide range of forms  adapted to needs of different municipalities – stay open at night too for  cultural and adult education</p>
    <p>England  – Early Excellence Centres <br />
        Italy  – nuove tipologie services aimed at giving more flexible learning and socialization opportunities  for children who don't need full-time child care</p>
    <ul>
        <li>suits non-working or P/T parents</li>
        <li>suits immigrants – help adapt and develop  networks and language skills</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Capabel Project, Amsterdam  – 32,000 immigrant district</p>
    <ul>
        <li>mobilize and coordinate existing organizations  and draw attention to actual needs of the target groups</li>
        <li>aims to minimize the number of children entering  school with developmental delays</li>
        <li>provides a crèche and tutoring for mothers to  learn language</li>
        <li>local district council support (one Govt. member  only on Steering C'tee)</li>
    </ul>
