<p><em>Children are  targeted relentlessly by fast food companies with irresponsible marketing  campaigns. As teachers &ndash; your voices should be raised in this debate.</em><br />
  </p>
<p>I sat on the beach last summer observing the parade of  bodies, recalling photographs taken of my children playing on that same beach  one generation before. The difference was massive. <br />
  Australians are now among the fattest people on the planet.  Twenty per cent of Australian children are overweight and 10 per cent are  obese. These young people will battle illness for most of their lives &ndash; type 2  diabetes, bone disease, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Studies put  the cost of obesity in children and adults in Australia in excess of $21  billion dollars. Researchers are warning that, for the first time in more than  a century, life expectancy may fall. <br />
  The psychological impact of obesity can be as damaging as the  physical effects with many children demonstrating increased levels of stress  with effects on their behaviour, concentration, learning ability and mood. I am  sure teachers observe these symptoms in classrooms across the state. <br />
  We are hearing more and more messages about healthy eating  but they get lost under the welter of products designed to tempt, which are  thrust under our noses. In supermarkets there are lollies, chips, chocolates  and biscuits all on shelves at children&rsquo;s eye level so they can pester their  parents. <br />
  It&rsquo;s not just the amount  of food we now eat but also what is in the food &ndash; the saturated fats and the  quantity of sugar &ndash; that make the battle to keep weight within normal range a  challenge for many people. The way food and drink is advertised creates  confusion about what are the contents of food products and what represents healthy  eating. Labels trumpet: 20 per cent less fat; 70 per cent less sugar, but the  real meaning is less clear.<br />
  Children are targeted  relentlessly by companies and advertisers with irresponsible marketing  campaigns. Fast foods with high fat, sugar and salt content are linked with  promotions for toys, movies and characters.&nbsp;  Shrek promoted the &lsquo;Belly Bulge Combo&rsquo; &ndash; popcorn, Coke and M&amp;Ms.<br />
  Sophistry bedevils the  debate about the food industry&rsquo;s role in the obesity epidemic. The industry  insists we should exercise more; the media industries insist it is not their  problem, they only offer entertainment. Government calls on parents to be the  guardians of their children: they can turn off the telly, say no, refuse to  buy, feed their children healthy food. <br />
  But business conspires  against us. Marketers are way ahead of the game as they bring the best minds to  bear on ways to access and develop the market. They discovered that people  generally would not buy two servings of french fries or two burgers, but they  would buy the super size, the value-added meal. Super-sizing led to a  revolution in eating. <br />
  A serving of McDonald&rsquo;s  french fries ballooned from 200 calories in 1960 to 610 calories. What was once  a 590 calorie McDonald&rsquo;s meal became 1550 calories. <br />
  We seem to admire excess  and extol the newsworthiness of extreme eating habits. Without urgent action our eating and exercise  habits will lead to a very unhealthy society and our social and health systems  will collapse under the demand for services. Prevention is the answer. We  should start with television, which has been a defining factor in shaping  children&rsquo;s views of the world since the late 1950s: television carries millions  of dollars worth of advertisements directed straight at children. <br />
  In Sweden, television advertising to children under 12 has  been banned since 1991. In the UK, television regulator Ofcom banned junk food  advertising in and around children&rsquo;s television programs in 2007. <br />
  But our television regulator, ACMA (Australian Communication  and Media Authority), claims the evidence linking food and beverage advertising  to children&rsquo;s eating habits is unclear. ACMA is unwilling to take precautionary  action because of the impact on the revenue of the commercial television  stations. <br />
  Industry self-regulation  is not working. The obesity crisis requires government intervention by  regulation of the food industry, the media industries (both advertising and  programming), and the introduction of healthy lifestyle initiatives for all  children. <br />
  As with smoking, we may  need to put warnings on the packaging of fast food and junk food: &ldquo;Eating this  product may be hazardous to your health.&rdquo;<br />
  As teachers who see the  evidence of overweight children in classrooms every day, your voices should be  raised in this debate.  </p>
