    <p><strong>Technology and learning in the early years</strong></p>

    <p><strong>VCAA Curriculum  Branch Conference, 11   November, 2008</strong></p>
    <p>You may well ask: Why should children in the early years  have any exposure to technologies?</p>
    <p>One answer is to ask: How many of you remember the character  called The Fonz in the family TV show <em>Happy  Days</em>? He seemed to be a bit of a lair, slicked back hair and 'cool'  attitude towards adults, school and sex. But you may not recall that when The  Fonz went to a library and took out books on his library card, the American  Library Association recorded a 400% increase in the issue and use of library  cards by children and teenagers. Such is the untapped power of modeling  behavior through effective media.</p>
    <p>We need to consider the media in early childhood development</p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>Because it's there and is an unavoidable part of their family and social context</li>
        <li>Because it has enormous potential to enhance their learning about the world</li>
        <li>Because they need to learn how to access, understand and control it as a core part of human competence in the modern world, and</li>
        <li>Because if they are not exposed and taught how to use it, they will be disadvantaged, victims of the growing digital divide.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are those who argue young children should watch no  television at all, should be kept away from computer games, the internet,  mobile phones, even radio. In my view, they are spitting into the wind.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The American Pediatricians wants no TV for children  under 2</li>
        <li>France and British Ofcom agree - study into <em>Teletubbies</em> &amp; <em>In the Night Garden</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>&nbsp;</em>A recent US  National Institutes of Health review (2008) of 28 years of studies linking  adolescent health and media use found the average time spent watching media -  45 hours per week (compared with 17 hours with parents &amp; 30 hrs at school<em>) </em></p>
    <ul><li><em>80% + studies found a &nbsp;link between children's screen time &amp;  obesity, smoking at an early age, drug use, early alcohol use and early sexual  behavior</em></li>
        <li><em>60% + studies found a link with poor academic  outcomes, low academic achievement and early attention problems</em></li>
        <li><em>One study found a positive link between the &nbsp;internet (certain types of websites) &amp;  better school performance, but there are &nbsp;few studies yet on internet, video games &amp;  cellphones.</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>The key problem is that of correlation versus causation  &amp; lack of controls in such research for other likely factors (low SES,  family problems, parental education, low self-esteem, peers and neighborhood  context)affecting both screen time and later 'outcomes'.</em></p>
    <p>Most of us would probably agree with the idea that time  spent glued to the computer or television screen should be limited, except that  the evidence of 'harm' is very thin. Even the data on such young children's  exposure to television shows they spend most of their time sleeping, or in  interaction with their Mum, or in random play in their cots, not watching TV.  And even for 2-6 year-olds, the data on which the American pediatricians base  their alarmist claims indicates that American children spend more time on  average playing games, both inside and outside, than they do watching TV. The extremes  are always used to justify moral panic. </p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>So, why expose children to any technology at all? &nbsp;The first answer is - </p>
    <p><strong>1. Because it's there and is an unavoidable part of their  family and social context</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>A third of 3-4 year-olds watch TV for 9+ hours per  week, average 2 hours a day</li>
        <li>Another third are 'low' TV viewers (-4 &frac12; hours)</li>
        <li>Mother at home - more TV watching, not less</li>
        <li>Over half turn TV on by themselves</li>
        <li>70% of parents are happy with that</li>
        <li>9 out of 10 children aged 7-8 have access to a computer  at home (10% in own bedroom) </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (LSAC,  2008)</p>
    <p>As well, we need to know where young children spend most of  their time. It's no use having a National Early Years Curriculum Framework  which ignores the main setting of early childhood development - the family  home. Just look at the following figures, extrapolated from COAG's estimates of  children in non-family child care settings.</p>
    <p><strong>Slide on 'Where are  they?'</strong></p>
    <p>- most young children spend most of their time at home, not  in formal child care settings.</p>
    <p>Nor are children totally passive 'victims' of the media:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Physical exercise - 87 minutes daily</li>
        <li>Read a story/talked or sung to - 78 mins.</li>
        <li>'Other play' - 70 minutes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But many families apply no controls on their children's  viewing at all. Indeed, in 61% of families 'background TV' is on all day,  exposing children to adult content. And Australia's regulatory body ACMA  found children aged 0-4 spend <strong>5 hours 48 mins</strong> <strong>per day</strong> on media  use (watching free TV, 154 mins; subscription TV, 194 mins)</p>
    <p>My second answer to Why expose young children to media  technology at all? Is -</p>
    <p><strong>2. Learning potential : </strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Because it has  enormous potential to enhance their learning about the world - often  unrecognised and under-utilised</strong></li>

    <p>Earlier this week, the federal Minister for Small Business,  Craig Emerson, wrote in <em>The Australian </em>that  (as Albert Einstein said) 'imagination is more important than knowledge'. Just  as the Industrial Revolution and the Enlightenment of the 1700s spread new  ideas that lifted living standards, the New Growth theorists in economics are  once again discovering the critical power of imagination and creativity in human  development. There is little point in teaching and testing for an understanding  of already established knowledge if there is not, at the same time,  encouragement of creativity in our young people, the development of pools of  creative talent that will take humanity forward. </p>
    <p>If you look carefully, you will find it is technology and  the new media, not just books and intellectual discussions in academe that are  driving this surge in creativity and imagination for today's young people. Radio  is still a potent educational force in Third World  countries, but the mobile phone is fast becoming a major tool of enlightenment.  As access to the internet grows, the spread of ideas - the true engine of  growth and change - becomes even more rapid.</p>
    <p>And it is in early childhood that the foundations of  curiosity, imagination and an exploring mind are laid. </p>
    <p>I want to remind you of the fact that most of an  individual's brain power is generated in the first years of life, especially  between birth and age 3, but certainly up to the age of 8. The wealth of  stimulating experience, reinforcement and strengthening of brain synapses, the  extension of synthesizing links and new pathways are the determinants of later  learning capacity, complex thought and expression. </p>

    <p>It was Howard Gardner and others who pointed out the  dangerous narrowness of current definitions of intelligence as measured by IQ  tests. Instead, they argued, the brain is capable of developing multiple  intelligences in the early years and every child needs to be given a chance to  operate across all forms of intelligence, not just cognitive forms as in  language and mathematics. Such intelligences develop in different pathways of  the brain, at different speeds and stages, yet they are inter-connected: for  example, musical and bodily/kinaesthetic intelligences affect mathematical  ability; interpersonal and self-understanding influence competence in many  human spheres of activity. </p>
    <p>But the key to all early childhood learning is curiosity and  exploration. It is only where such qualities are encouraged that new  experiences are gained, learnings reinforced, new ideas stimulated, questions  raised and new pathways of learning explored.</p>
    <p>In the jargon, this is often called '<strong>play-based learning'</strong>, but that's too vague and often leads to  unguided, unstructured play rather than to a carefully planned series of  curriculum experiences in early childhood settings. The skilled kindergarten  teacher of course plans a rich classroom environment and uses every experience  to encourage a love of learning, a curiosity about the world and a respect for  the vast array of human ideas and practices. But too often, they ignore the  power of the media, distrusting what is, indeed, bad content, the distortions  of commercial advertising, the shallow treatment of ideas and forgetting that  the media (poor as it often is) is the source of much of a child's imaginative  experience and the source of much of their knowledge and understanding of the  world around them. How could it be otherwise when a third of 4 year-olds are  watching television for more than nine hours a week, and another third are  watching four and a half hours? Worse, when Mum is at home they are watching  more television, not less. Media are an unavoidable part of family life. &nbsp;</p>
    <p>Television can be a wonderful  story-teller.&nbsp; The benefits that flow to  children from good storytelling are many and television's learning outcomes  need to be considered as part of the 0-8 curriculum. Children have always been  drawn to drama over factual kids' programming. (SPAA, 2008)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Children's future at school  and work is enhanced if they learn to read well. Most importantly, stories are  the glue that binds us together as a community; they give children a shared  purpose, a roadmap for their lives and teach them about their feelings, their  tribe, their culture, their place in the world. That is why Australian and local programming is important for children.</li>
        <li>When done well, television  programs can stimulate a child's imagination and open up the infinite  opportunities that life presents. Like good books, good television programs can  extend their understanding of their  world. Stories are particularly effective in helping children develop  emotionally, try out roles not yet possible in the real world. Television can  expand their world of play and take them places they could not imagine, help  them experience troubling emotions vicariously. </li>
        <li>Fairytales  where children cope with fearful situations have been used for centuries for  this purpose and the Disney Company, Dreamworld and Pixar&nbsp; have tapped into this store through their  animated films with family entertainment - but sometimes the stories produced  for mass consumption around the world have become so bland they have lost their  original purpose. </li>
        <li>Preschoolers  love humour. They need to hear wonderfully funny and richly imaginative stories  and play inventive games to help stimulate their imaginations. Programs for  them should solicit laughter and enjoyment without degenerating into corny  situations or patronizing them.</li>
        <li>This 0-5 age  group is moving from a self-centred view of the world to a more social outlook,  so observing the experience of others in stories on television can enhance  their understanding of their  world.&nbsp; Preschoolers are also forming  their personal style, their sense of identity within their family, in a sex  role, outside the family and within an ethnic or racial group. Television  programming feeds into this emerging social self and can be used to present a  wide range of role models and images that show different  cultures, styles and environments.</li>
        <li>Toddlers  move from being amoral to being 'moral absolutists' with a rigid sense of right  and wrong. Not until close to pre-school age do they begin to understand the  consequences of their actions. They can interpret violent conclusions to  stories as a signal that the 'goodies'  have the right to eliminate the 'baddies'. They are on a journey to discovering how to connect emotions and motivations  of characters to their actions. A program can be open-ended and lead to a discussion about valid rules and solutions. </li>
        <li>Good  programming can teach valuable lessons about living in a community. Children  need to learn that they are part of a group; they can't always win and life is  not just a competition, that trying and effort are admirable in themselves.  They need to see human endeavour at its best, not just the side that produces  conflict.&nbsp; </li>
    </ul>
    <p>All these life  lessons can be conveyed through stories on film, video, DVDs and television.  The important thing for parents to understand, during the early years of their  children's development, is that stories do matter and should be selected with  care. This takes time and effort. We have come to regard television as a  babysitter and we rely on others - the ABC, the commercial networks, the  regulator (ACMA) and the censor - to classify and decide for us what children  should be allowed to see. The classification system is a guide but if we simply  leave children in front of television while we do other things we need to  remember we don't know what the programs are teaching them. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <div>
        <p><strong>Parents and teachers need  to consider:</strong></p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <ul>
        <li>Television  is a wonderful resource and there are things television can teach visually and  dramatically that will enrich and extend the concept development of pre-school  and the early primary school child. They will learn more effectively if you discuss and share their viewing.</li>
        <li>You can't  watch and discuss everything the  children view, but any time spent sharing these media  messages is of value.</li>
        <li>We waste  our children's brain power, which is surging in those early years, if we allow  their time to be spent viewing programs of inconsequence with a commercial  purpose.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Just as parents  should choose good books or effective toys, they should choose good television  programs. We recommend parents take a very active role in their children's  programming choices, viewing with them whenever possible, discussing storylines, characters, their actions and  behaviour and lessons to be learned.&nbsp; We  know from research, the learning will be more effective when a parent or  teacher scaffolds, or builds, on the learning within a program.</p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Computerised games. </strong></p>
    <p>There is a  growing body of evidence that demonstrates games are effective and valuable  tools for learning. Games have an enthusiastic following with children from a  very early age and across all ages.&nbsp; (For  a parent's guide to video games see Jeannie Novak and Luis Levy, <em>Play the Game,</em> Thompson Course  Technology 2008, (<a href="http://www.courseptr.com/">http://www.courseptr.com</a>) </p>
    <p>Because most  teachers and policy-makers don't play games, they are not aware of just how  sophisticated young learners' iterative strategies can become. There is a  science to game playing. No one tells the kids the rules; they figure them out  by playing. They seek information  and piece together data from many places. They make decisions quickly which  have clear consequences. They become experts at multi-tasking and parallel  processing and learn to collaborate with others over a range of networks. Game  players can acquire these skills at a very early age. Four and 5 year olds are  known to play such games as <em>The Sims</em> (the most popular computer game ever made, which is essentially a 'living  dollhouse') and <em>Roller Coaster Tycoon</em>&nbsp; where the basic goal is to create a  successful theme park.</p>
    <p>In the early  years children naturally love to learn as they love to play and appropriate  video and computer games can combine these experiences very effectively. </p>
    <div>
        <p><strong>0-8 year olds are learning  many cognitive skills which could be assisted by games </strong>:<br />
        &nbsp; - to attend and concentrate<br />
        - to associate words and symbols with  objects<br />
        - to perceive and discriminate<br />
        - to identify similarity and difference<br />
        - to classify objects<br />
        - to see order or relationships<br />
        - to develop concepts, e.g. space, size,  shape<br />
        - to explore and be curious <br />
        - to manipulate<br />
        - to use creative imagination &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    </div>
    <p>Mark Prensky  (2006) shows in his book '<em>Don't bother me  Mum, I'm learning!</em>' how games help cognitive development in progressively  complex ways.</p>
    <div>
        <p><strong>Games teach children about: </strong></p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <ul>
        <li>cause  and effect relationships</li>
        <li>long  term winning versus short term gains</li>
        <li>creating  order from seeming chaos</li>
        <li>second  order consequences</li>
        <li>complex  system behaviours</li>
        <li>counter-intuitive  results</li>
        <li>using  obstacles as motivation</li>
        <li>the  value of persistence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Prensky,  2006)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>So far there has  been little attempt to integrate game-playing into the classroom.&nbsp; This will need to change. Games can be used  with positive results to assist learning from 3-8.</p>
    <p>Pre-schoolers  are inducted into many forms of technology before they can read, write or even  talk clearly, particularly if they have older siblings. Three year-olds can  learn to manipulate a mouse and should be encouraged to do so.&nbsp; For this generation a computer is nothing  special; it is simply another tool in their environment which they will need to  master.&nbsp; There is no research with  pre-schoolers which documents their capabilities with technology and the  potential for learning games can engender.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Moreover, we learn only a little from current academic  research because it has been too narrowly focused. It ignores the most powerful  demonstration of the influence of media  - the way in which advertising has produced a huge market in children's toys,  games, characters and spin-off products which even very young children demand  their parents buy for them. For example, in the five domains of child  development examined by Children Now (2006) findings  are at times surprising and useful, other studies  trivial and contradictory.</p>
    <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li><strong><em>Social       and emotional development.</em></strong></li>
        <ul type="disc">
        <li>Children        who use the computer show superior spoken communication and cooperation,        can play better within a set of rules, share leadership roles on the        computer, take turns, and initiate interactions.</li>
        <li>Computer        use does not, for the majority, isolate children from others but helps        connect them with others. Computer activity is intrinsically motivating        and produces a longer attention span, enhances self-concept and attitudes        to learning because it insists on mastery from level to level, and only        in some cases is linked to an increase in aggressive behavior. </li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <ol start="2" type="1">
        <li><strong><em>Language       development</em></strong></li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The research on interactive technology use shows  children learn to use more complex speech patterns and higher levels of verbal  communication because they tend to narrate what they are doing as they play.  They have better phonological awareness<em>, </em>tell  more sophisticated stories and have better writing skills. Interactive story  books allow children to control the story and ask for help (and get it). </li>
    </ul>
    <ol start="3" type="1">
        <li><strong><em>Physical       wellbeing and motor development</em></strong></li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li>There is little research here, and concerns  about addictive time use and  physical hazards such as eye strain, obesity, radiation  and muscular-skeletal problems, are all reflective of high-end users rather  than the majority of children whose daily physical play activity equals and often  exceeds their use of media  technology.</li>
        <li>The major effect seems to be on physical  (in)activity and food habits, leading to the current alarming figures on  overweight and obesity. Yet ACMA says there is not enough evidence that  television advertising has such an influence: they only need to look at the  $&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; billion market in&nbsp;&nbsp; ???? </li>
        <li>There is evidence that computer use helps disabled children develop better motor skills and  opens up a wider world for them socially. (For examples of using media for therapy, dexterity, hand-eye coordination and social contact see Novak &amp; Levy,  2008)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol start="4" type="1">
        <li><strong><em>Cognition       and general knowledge</em></strong></li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The research findings in this area are mixed,  showing greater interest and engagement but not necessarily better verbal or  visual learning. </li>
        <li>Programs such as <em>Barney &amp; Friends, Sesame Street, Blue's Clues, Dora the Explorer</em>,  etc. claim to combine over 100 potential teaching elements and enhance  children's performance in social skills, imagination, singing and dancing  through active engagement with program content. Cognitive gains included  numbers, letters and vocabulary; social learning such as taking turns, sharing,  cooperation; physical improvements in small and large motor skills; and  emotional lessons in dealing with anger, disappointment,  feeling sad/happy. </li>
        <li>Programs such as <em>Blue's Clues</em> have learning objectives rooted in child development  theory. In contrast, programs focused on selling toys, with a mere pretence of  educational theory, will be far less successful in enhancing child development  goals. You have to wonder about the ABC's <em>Bananas  in Pyjamas</em> and the fofty-year-old program <em>Play</em><em> School</em>.</li>
        <li>Repeated research emphasizes the point that  children learn most when their parents or other adults 'mediate' what they are seeing or doing, whether that  is on the TV screen or in the kindergarten classroom. </li>
        <li>If the software is developmentally appropriate,  there are gains for pre-schoolers in intelligence scores, nonverbal skills,  manual dexterity and long-term memory and there are better learning gains from  home use of interactive technology compared with limited use at school. </li>
        <li>Despite mothers' belief that watching  educational TV programs will enhance their children's cognitive development,  there is little research evidence to support it, in part because there are so  few programs designed specifically for these early years. Many claims that  programs are 'educational' rest, in any case, on narrow definitions of  learning, such as knowing the letters of the alphabet, numbers, shapes and  colors. </li>
    </ul>
    <ol start="5" type="1">
        <li><strong><em>Approaches       to learning</em></strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The computer is inherently adaptable to  different learning styles, but there is as yet little evidence of that  adaptability being harnessed in the cause of more individually appropriate  learning. </li>
        <li>Computers seem to be a powerful compensatory tool  for disabled children, supporting independent functioning and promoting a  virtual play environment for children with special needs. In this area,  interactive computer use opens up opportunities for social contact and  learning. </li>
        <li>As well, the computer gives children access in  ways not possible in the real world, through virtual tours of historic sites,  geographical landmarks, art galleries, the whole world of information available  on the internet. Indeed, the key concern here is more the plethora of (often  unreliable) information and the need for parents and teachers to act as guides  in the critical use and interpretation of knowledge.</li>
        <li>Clearly, if programs stimulate the child's  curiosity (whether through documentaries, or news, or drama) they will have an  ongoing impact on learning styles.</li>
        <li>One crucial proviso is that families who see  technology as useful are better able to take advantage of the educational  opportunities offered by the technology. </li>
        <li>Several studies have demonstrated the strong  link between <em>Sesame Street</em> and children's readiness  for kindergarten, regardless of socio-economic status, and those effects can  last well into high school performance. And, in more recent years, <em>Sesame    Street</em> has gone beyond the basics of number  and the alphabet to incorporate elements of Howard Gardner's 'multiple  intelligences'.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The evidence is that quality TV programs and games can be  designed for 3-8 year-olds and understood by them at different  levels, the younger ones taking in messages that match their level of cognitive  development, older children interpreting them at a more sophisticated level.  Moreover, children will watch good programs repeatedly, and keep watching them  as they grow older, learning different  things each time, precisely because they can engage with quality content&nbsp; in increasingly sophisticated ways. The young  brain's plasticity, its capacity to learn through repetition and reinforcement,  the forging of new connections, make good media  experiences a potent learning and developmental tool.</p>
    <p>The main point about learning via the media is much the same  as for any other mode of learning: assistance (from a parent, carer or teacher)  needs to be 'scaffolded' (in Vygotsky's terms, targeted at the learner's 'Zone  of Proximal Development' - the difference between the child's actual level of  development and the level they could achieve with the assistance of a more  competent adult or peer.) Technology makes it possible to design programs that  are not only appropriate to a particular age group, but also to different  developmental levels within that age group. Pre-schoolers' learning needs to be  rooted in their real-life, personal experiences, should not be too abstract  given their underdeveloped reasoning skills, should feature real children in  program action and open up opportunities for collaborative play with other  children, and be responsive to their developmental needs. </p>
    <p><strong>A third reason to  include media in early childhood development and learning is media literacy as  a critical skill.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>3. Media literacy is crucial:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Because they  need to learn how to access, understand and control technology as a core part  of human competence in the modern world</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ability to </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access</strong> the media - almost universal</li>
        <li>Functional literacy - how to <strong>use</strong> technology -  learn without formal instruction</li>
        <li><strong>Understand</strong> the media - advertising &amp;  consumer persuasion; reality vs representation; reliability of information  (internet); facts vs opinion; managing emotional responses to violence, sex,  news</li>
        <li>Being better <strong>informed citizens</strong> - values</li>
        <li><strong>Create</strong> their own productions - the 'creative  republic'</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But it's the <strong><em>content&nbsp; </em></strong>that really matters! </p>
    <p>In our longer paper  for the VCAA, we argue for a broader definition of media literacy than the  ususal model used in media literacy courses: as <strong><em>accessing,</em></strong> <strong><em>understanding, <u>using</u> and creating media <u>for learning</u></em></strong>. It's not just about  having technical skills, being protected from nasty advertisers or making any  old video for YouTube. </p>
    <p>Finally, my fourth answer to the question Why expose young  children at all? Is</p>
    <p><strong>The Digital Divide:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Because if they  are not exposed and taught how to use it, they will be disadvantaged, victims  of the growing digital divide.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Lo income - more TV time, less computer time, less  reading, no fast cable internet</li>
        <li>Regional and ethnic differences in access &amp; usage</li>
        <li>Parental attitudes to media &amp; learning</li>
        <li>Parents' ability to help, guide, communicate</li>
        <li>Big gap re. the new 'participatory culture', creative  commons, links with peers (age 8-18, 40% have own material on internet, 1 in 3  a page on a social networking site</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To summarise, </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The evidential base is shaky, but we cannot and should  not ignore the power and potential for good rather than harm from modern  technology. No early childhood curriculum framework can ignore what goes on in  the home in the pre-school years. It is their major learning environment and it  one saturated with media whether we like it or not.</li>
        <li>Just a final word or two about the opponents to  technology. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Steiner-Waldorf approach to children's education, which  has the worthy goals of using the arts and physical activities such as music to  humanise and educate the whole child - head, heart and hands -&nbsp; so they can (by themselves) impart meaning to  their lives, confuses such aims with an anti-materialist stance. Steiner's  'anthroposophy' holds that man is born into a sub-human state and 'excessive  modernism' lets loose 'Luciferous forces' that cause illness in later life. The  job of education is to awaken their inner nature to 'the starry worlds in the  soul and spirit' and Steiner schools strongly discourage use of electronic  media, especially television and computers, because of the physical effects on  the developing child, questionable media content, and because using such  technology hampers development of the child's imagination. Claims without  evidence.</p>
    <p>Some writers lump such theories together with the Kodaly  concept of music teaching and the Laban techniques of movement and dance. There  is a similar opposition to mechanisation, an insistence on real experience, on  physicality as the pathway to wider understanding and on helping children find  their own meaning and emotional truth. Yet Kodaly used the tape recorder to  help students identify patterns in sound, and Laban talks about acting  technology and the technical analysis of dance and choreography. So we have to  be cautious about what we mean by using technology in early childhood  education.</p>
    <p>The views of technology opponents could be dismissed as  troglodyte or Luddite, a head-in-the-sand approach that used to apply equally  to letting kids read comic books or go to the movies. But they are dressed up  in educational theories which have superficial appeal - the whole child needs a  fully rounded education, let the physical body develop first before the  intellect, encourage activity not passivity, protect the child from unwholesome  messages from a crassly commercial media machine. We could all agree, but where  is the evidence for such propositions?</p>
    <p>In stark contrast, the Montessori approach to early  childhood education holds that the classroom should be <strong><em>a reflection of the home, the  community and the wider world.</em></strong> Realistically, its advocates have  acknowledged that media technology is an increasingly significant feature of  every child's home, community and the wider society. So they adopt a proactive  stance, not a head in the sand one. (See Boyd, Barbara F., 'Assistive technology for every child', Proquest,  Montessori Life, Articles at BNET, 2008) Just as literacy is the foundation for  academic learning, computer literacy is considered a critical skill for all  young children. Montessori teachers are urged to use technology as both a  resource for learning and as a tool for effective teaching. </p>
    <p>In a high technology society, they must integrate technology  in all its forms into the Montessori classroom and curriculum areas. Assistive technology is especially useful for  children with disabilities, enabling them to express ideas, draw pictures, link  the spoken word to the written word (through Dragon Speaking Naturally),  manipulate on the screen basic mathematical concepts and visit websites on  places physically out of reach. </p>
    <p>Montessori teachers are being actively trained in how to use  computers, digital cameras, tape recorders, good quality television programs  and search engines to enhance their teaching of&nbsp;  language, mathematics, history, geography, science and other areas,  through interactive tools such as BigKeys, drawing software, IntelliTools,  Kidspiration, Boardwalk, Go Talk, the Discovery Channel, This-Professional and  Eyewitness Children's Encyclopedia. There is a wealth of material available and  it is getting more sophisticated every day. </p>
    <p>Two problems - most teachers are unaware, unskilled or  afraid of technology; and today's children are way ahead of them in media  literacy and computer skills. We have to, therefore: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Regulate TV content</li>
        <li>Utilise media within the early years curriculum and  guide that use effectively</li>
        <li>Train and re-train teachers and other early childhood  professionals so they are both media literate and ahead of the children they  teach. </li>
    </ul>
