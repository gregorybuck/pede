<p><strong>Does television have a future? </strong><br />
        Patricia Edgar,  June 2007</p>
    <p><strong><em>&ldquo;Thirty second commercials are  dead.&nbsp; Television is dead.&nbsp; Everybody is dead -- except Google.&nbsp; And itunes.&nbsp; And YouTube&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
    <p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>I have been living in the heart of the  digital Mecca of the Western world,  the tree-lined, sunny city of Palo Alto  adjacent to Stanford University  campus; Steven P Jobs, the founder of <em>Apple</em>,  jogged past my door. Around the corner stands a landmark, the garage where Bill  Hewlett and Dave Packard founded <em>Hewlett</em><em>-Packard </em>and spawned Silicon Valley. South  in neighbouring Mountain View  is <em>Googleplex</em> where the famous students who dropped out of Graduate   School at Stanford, less than 10  years ago, to create their powerful search engine <em>Google</em>work to expand their mammoth. Now valued at $126 billion <em>Google</em> is  transforming access to information in a revolution as profound as that prompted  by Gutenberg's printing press. Just north, in Menlo Park,  you can find the room rented by two young guys who started business in an  office above a pizzeria and created <em>YouTube</em><em>. Yahoo </em>too  was spawned by Stanford graduate students. Stanford   University and its computer science  department - now housed in a building paid for and named after Bill Gates - has  been the engine that ushered in the internet era.</p>
    <p>Every day the newspapers carry  articles about the frenzied business of new technology. Private equity  companies are getting into the game, as the tech companies are credited with a  new level of maturity, investing $109.9 billion by June 2007. The battle between  television and online media giants for market dominance is intense; there is  both excitement and desperation as companies compete to solve challenges that  will make or break them. </p>
    <p>No one appears to know where the  technology and content industries are headed and what will be the effect of  this technical revolution on traditional media. The television networks are  scrambling to retain audiences and seek viewer loyalty among the 'affluencers' - the affluent, influential and engaged young  viewers who are avid consumers of new technology and whose buying decisions are  influencing the future of programming.</p>
    <p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Apple</em> is competing on all fronts, redefining the industry, and  challenging its archrival<em> Microsoft</em> with the release of a Windows browser. Dubbed &ldquo;the Jesus Phone&rdquo;, &ldquo;the most  out-look-changing piece of electronics to come along in years&rdquo; (NYT, June  27,2007), <em>Apple's</em> new iphone - phone, cum web browser and music player, released  on&nbsp; June 29th, aims to bridge the worlds  of technology and entertainment. Mr Jobs claims it is  5 years ahead of the hand-set industry; video rentals are the next target.<em> Apple</em> TV has arrived in stores, joining  the <em>Mac,</em> the <em>iPod</em>and the<em> iPhone </em>as one of four key businesses. &ldquo;I'm a Mac&rdquo; computers with the new Leopard  operating system will be released later in the year. <em>Apple</em> and <em>Microsoft</em> have  been moving to challenge television by enhancing desktops with software  packages like Front Row or Media Centre which display videos and play music  with a simplified interface. PCs are disadvantaged in the family room because  they can take a long time to start, blow noise and are susceptible to viruses.  Consumers demand more and care less about how they get it. </p>
    <p>Sergey Brin  and Larry Page, the brilliant inventors of<em> Google Inc.</em> with its corporate motto - &ldquo;Don't Be  Evil&rdquo;- are being viewed more as predators than renaissance men as <em>Google</em> competes  with all comers. The young students began with a vision, not the desire to make  money. They held venture capitalists at bay so they would not lose control of  their company and had a deep aversion to advertising, fearing it would corrupt  search results. But in the end success is built on growth; growth requires  money and investors require a business model and a CEO. <em>Google's</em> hypergrowth,  fueled by a partnership in advertising has led a revolution, as companies shift  billions of dollars of their ad spending from television, radio, newspapers and  magazines onto the Internet. The nature of advertising and the marketing of  goods and services is changing. As the industry leader  in information retrieval and the information access point on most issues,<em> Google's</em> evolution is being increasingly viewed with suspicion. </p>
    <p>The company's entry into China  is seen as cynical profiteering, despiteclaims <em>Google</em> will  reform from within. Once relatively indifferent to government affairs, <em>Google</em><em> Inc</em> is seeking help from Washington  to fight the rise of Web censorship worldwide. They argue Internet restrictions  are international trade barriers like tariffs. Government censorship is a  potential threat to <em>Google's</em>advertising-driven business model. </p>
    <p><em>Google's</em> shift in business  philosophy was evident in its recent tiff with <em>EBay, </em>one of <em>Google's</em> largest clients. <em>EBay</em> has taken its  online advertising elsewhere after <em>Google</em> attempted to capture <em>EBay's</em> 9000 buyers and sellers with a free party to promote Google's Checkout online payment service. <em>Google</em> cancelled  the party. <em>Google</em> has a controversial new service,<em> Street  View,</em> which reveals 360 degree photographs of neighbourhoods  and captures what goes on behind open windows. <em>Google's</em> power, its broad reach,  and its tactics are sounding alarm bells and Mary Anne Ostrom  (<em>San Jose Mercury News</em>, June 10, 2007) reports suggestions  the company is attempting to become the 51st State and change the  definition of mainstream, as presidential candidates post videos on <em>YouTube</em> and buy  ads on <em>Google</em><em>.</em> </p>
    <p>Privacy groups are calling on the  Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to review the recent transactions proposed by<em> Google </em>to  acquire <em>DoubleClick</em> , and <em>Microsoft </em>toacquire<em> aQuantive,</em> and for the FTC to set long overdue industry standards for consumer privacy on  the Internet. ( <em>San</em><em> Jose</em><em> Mercury News</em>, June 7, 2007). <em>Google</em>is responding by expanding its lobbying efforts in Washington  to help win the approval of its <em>DoubleClick</em> deal. And <em>Google</em> deputy general counsel has  gone public to put the lie to criticisms of Google's  privacy policy and calm the phenomenon of &ldquo;Goolephobia&rdquo;(<em>San Jose Mercury  News</em> 17/6/07). In Australia  the ACCC hit <em>Google</em> with a law suit, July 12, alleging misleading and deceptive conduct and  breaches of the Trade Practices Act over sponsored links on the <em>Google</em> website.  This case could be an international landmark.</p>
    <p>Both <em>Google</em> and <em>Microsoft</em> have their sights set on the mobile Web, but carriers  will do all they can to limit their access to new revenues through their  infrastructure. The <em>AT&amp;T</em> ( <em>Apple's</em> iPhone partner) is the largest phone company in the US,  as well as the biggest wireless carrier. CEO Edward Whittacre  says of the search companies, &ldquo;They don't have any fiber out there. They don't  have any wires.&nbsp; They don't have  anything. They use my lines for free -and that's bull&rdquo;. ( <em>San</em><em> Jose</em><em> Mercury News</em>, June 6). </p>
    <p>Technology is changing faster than  fashion. <em>YouTube</em>did not exist&nbsp; two years ago.&nbsp; In October 2006 <em>Google</em> paid $1.65 billion to buy  the 20-month-old website. Rupert Murdoch and his News Corp then acquired <em>My Space</em> for $580 million. Today the  television networks, and the media companies that own them, define themselves  not as programmers, but as content providers.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Thirty second commercials are  dead. Television is dead.&nbsp; Everybody is  dead -- except <em>Google</em>.  And<em> iTunes</em>.  And <em>YouTube</em>&rdquo;,  pronounced Gary Carter, the president of Creative Networks atFremantleMedia,  the company that dreamed up <em>Pop Idol</em> in the UK, which became&nbsp; <em>American Idol,</em> and <em>Australian Idol, </em>a franchise described by <em>San Francisco Magazine</em>, (June 2007)<br />
        as the  definitive blockbuster hit on American television in the 21st  Century.</p>
    <p>This is a valley where you don't  wonder if the world is about to change drastically. It already has. </p>
    <p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>'Television Executives, in search  of the next new hit, are as desperate as the housewives on </em></strong><strong><em>Wisteria    Lane</em></strong><strong><em>&rdquo;.</em></strong></p>
    <p>The commercial television networks  finally understand they must work hard to stay on top and see their salvation -  as they have always done - in new program ideas. In this environment, network  executives in search of the next new hit, are as desperate as the housewives on  Wisteria Lane. They know  the business model they have relied on for decades - a single revenue stream  based entirely on advertising - is obsolete. The major TV Networks were the  reliable place to go for advertisers seeking broad audiences, but the mass  audience is now fragmenting. Ratings still rule and new revenue streams must be  found, so when new programs fail production heads roll; the turnover among  television executives is high. </p>
    <p>Following two decades of mergers,  the massive media companies <em>Viacom(</em><em>NBC), Time-  Warner (CBS), Disney(ABC) </em>and<em> News  Corp</em> <em>(FOX) </em>have found size alone  is not the answer. Adding a movie studio, a big television production arm and a  well-stocked library of intellectual content to a Network has not been enough,  and at midnight on February 7th 2009 they face  a major upheaval: analogue airways in the United    States will cease to signal local television  and programming will be transmitted exclusively over the digital spectrum. Australia  will follow in 2010-12.</p>
    <p>The networks are gambling that one  thing will not change, no matter how television is to be viewed - on computer  monitors, on cell-phones, or on massive TV screens: people will always want to  see hit shows. In this conviction they rely on history. A network can rise from  the ashes with one hit. <em>Desperate  Housewives</em>, which has attracted more than 21 million viewers - the most  watched new show on ABC Network in a decade and a hit in every English speaking  country in the world - proved this, as did <em>Lost, </em>which drew 18 million viewers and  became a phenomenon from its first week on the air. <em>American Idol </em>took Fox to the position of top rating network.</p>
    <p>Finding these shows requires  imaginative production executives who are bold decision makers. Such attributes  are rare within network television structures; where so much is at stake,  risk-taking can be terminal. When break-out shows arrive, it is usually as a  result of a whim, incredible luck and the courage and fortitude of a daring  producer. Hits which will keep the networks viable are not easy to come by.</p>
    <p>Bill Carter, author of <em>Desperate Networks(2006), </em>outlines the hazardous route taken by Marc Cherry the creator and producer,  who endured repeated rejection and a life of poverty and despair to get <em>Desperate Housewives </em>on air.&nbsp; Lloyd Braun, the Network executive who  believed in and shepherded <em>Lost</em> through  the ABC, overcame doubts, resistance, disrespect and termination before he was  vindicated. These two shows alone saved the bacon of two Networks and launched  Network 7's revival in Australia. </p>
    <p>The UK's<em> Pop Idol </em>was picked up by Fox on the  order of Rupert Murdoch who overruled his uninterested executives. Murdoch  insisted the format remain true to the UK original which meant Simon Cowell, the abrasive judge from the UK show, was paid $36  million for 90 minutes of work a week - thought to be the highest paid  performer per minute on network television - to secure his services.&nbsp; The investment was considered justified when <em>American Idol </em>returned astonishing  ratings - 33.5 million viewers. </p>
    <p>Television remains the advertising  flagship with US$65.4 billion going to the Networks in 2006, but advertisers  are beginning to spread their assets<strong> </strong>around,  with more money going to on-line media, and they are asking the Networks  difficult questions. </p>
    <p>As a result, network programming  is changing; networks are learning to let go of beloved series they have run  into the ground. Sit-Coms like <em>Friends, Seinfeld, Cheers</em>, once the staple of American network  television, are hard to find as new ideas fail.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Family television, where the  entire family gathers together around the television on a Saturday night, has  gone. Such viewing seems alien to kids now, many of whom have their own  televisions, computers and iPods. By age six&nbsp; 33% of children have televisions in their  bedrooms and 23% have VCRs (<em>The Media  Family: Electronic Media in the lives of infants, toddlers, preschoolers and  their parents</em>, The Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation Report, Victoria Rideout, Elizabeth Hamel, May 2006). </p>
    <p>While many Americans claim to want  a refuge from the sex and violence of TV, and major sponsors including Proctor  and Gamble and FedEx have funded The Family Friendly Programming Forum (which  underwrites script development, programs and scholarships for students  interested in producing family entertainment), shows seeded by the Forum,  including <em>Commander in Chief</em>, failed  to maintain ratings. Whereas once, multi-generational dramas, such as <em>The Walton's</em> or <em>Eight is Enough,</em> would hold the family audience, today, if families  sit down together to view television, it will be to watch <em>American Idol.</em></p>
    <p>Game shows remain popular; serialised dramas are few, with <em>Heroes</em> an exception. British shows are in,  following the spectacular success of <em>American  Idol </em>and <em>The Office</em>. Once ignored  as a program source, Britain  is being monitored for new ideas. </p>
    <p>Reality shows dominate the  schedules and the ratings; they are cheap to make and if they fail the network  hasn't invested heavily. What they lose increasingly is respect. The most  degrading example of a tacky grab for ratings this season was <em>The Bachelor, </em>with Mark Philippoussis  as a vacuous beefcake - claiming to be searching for the love of his life -  encouraging women over 40 years, &ldquo;the cougars', to compete with 20 year olds  ,'the kittens', for his affection. </p>
    <p>Looking at television, facing a  technical upheaval, there is little evidence of innovation in programming  ideas. Networks continue to draw on the past for ideas to reinvent. </p>
    <p>The annual TV &ldquo;upfronts&rdquo;,  when the top network executives present their program line-ups (along with an  argument that they know what viewers they will attract) to dubious Madison  Avenue advertisers, was held in May. </p>
    <p>Mr  Murdoch's Fox Network is number one among young viewers (those whomadvertisers covet) but its success is built almost  entirely on the popularity of two series - <em>American  Idol </em>and<em> House</em>.&nbsp; Their new line up will include four new  dramas, three new comedies and three new reality shows including <em>The Search for the Next Great American Band</em> and <em>Nashville</em>, a docu-soap  which follows a group of young hopefuls trying to make it in country music. </p>
    <p>NBC, which is in a rating's slump,  is betting on science fiction, fantasy and escapism to attract viewers along  with a spin-off from<em> Heroes </em>- their  hit from last season - called <em>Heroes:  Origins</em>, and a revisionist version of<em> Bionic Woman (</em>a series from the 70s). </p>
    <p>ABC, already home to the biggest  drama hits will spin off <em>Grey's Anatomy</em> with <em>Private Practice. </em>In the spirit  of <em>Desperate Housewives </em>ABC has  another new drama <em>Dirty Sexy Money,</em> in which Peter Krause ( <em>Six Feet Under</em>)  plays a lawyer for an absurdly wealthy, venal, corrupt family.&nbsp; <em>Cashmere  Mafia </em>is yet another series attempting to replicate the successful formula  of <em>Sex and the City</em> with a group of New    York women in and out of romance.</p>
    <p>CBS is exploring film noir and  themes like vampires, swingers and singing casino workers. <em>Viva Laughlin</em>, (based on a quirky, dark, UK  show <em>Viva </em><em>Blackpool</em><em>)</em>,<em> s</em>tars Hugh Jackman: characters lip-sync  contemporary songs in the style of the British series <em>Pennies from Heaven. Swingtown </em>is a  serial drama set in the 1970s which centres on a  couple who move into suburban Chicago  and learn, to their shock and fascination, that most  of their neighbours are into the swinging culture. </p>
    <p>There will be a new CBS game show, <em>The Power of 10</em> where contestants  guess answers to questions about the social behaviour  of Americans and lifestyle trends, for the ultimate prize of $10 million. (<em>Who wants to be a Millionaire?</em> has had  its day)<em> Kid Nation</em> is a new reality  show which involves a group of 40 kids (aged eight to 15) who have 40 days to  build a new society with no adult supervision - a Lord of the Flies type  situation.</p>
    <p>There is nothing revolutionary  here.</p>
    <p><strong><em>The real content revolution is  taking place in advertising.</em></strong> </p>
    <p>The scrambling for new programming  ideas is taking place amid growing awareness that people are watching  television differently. The traditional system of measuring TV ratings counts  only those viewers watching the live broadcast; those who record and watch  online are lost to the networks who then cannot charge advertisers as much for  commercials.&nbsp; Revising the traditional  system of measuring TV ratings of programs is gaining urgency because an  estimated 17% of American households now own DVRs. In  some cities DVR penetration exceeds 25%.&nbsp;  Several popular shows, like <em>Grey's  Anatomy</em>, <em>The Office</em> and <em>24</em> are being watched, increasingly, as  recordings, not when they go to air. To deal with this new phenomenon Neilson  Media Research, the ratings arbiter, has agreed to count viewers who watch the  show live or within 72 hours of a program's original appearance in a formula  called &ldquo;live plus three&rdquo;. The networks are pushing for a &ldquo;live plus seven&rdquo;  standard.</p>
    <p>While the search for ideas remains  desperate,<strong> (</strong>with most series failing  in their first season, often in their first weeks), the threat posed to the  Networks by the changing face of advertising and the potential loss of their  revenue base is terrifying executives. The online advertising sector has grown  wildly in the past 10 years, increasing from $907 million in 1997 when it  accounted for less than one per cent of all advertising.&nbsp; Now interactive ads represent 5.9% of the  $286 billion spent last year by advertisers. As a sign of the times online ad  spending increased 17% last year to $9.8 billion as opposed to only five per  cent growth for television according to Jaimal Yogis,  (<em>San Francisco Magazine</em>, June 2007)</p>
    <p>TiVo, podcasting, broadband television, and even the simple  remote control, mean viewers no longer have to watch the ads if they don't want  to and more and more people don't. In its first quarterly profit this year  digital video recorder pioneer TiVo has posted a  small net profit.</p>
    <p>2006 was a pivotal year:  down-loading had taken off and the networks began to face the reality born of  an explosion in technology.&nbsp; In response,  Disney made deals to sell episodes of <em>Desperate  Housewives</em> on a video iPod, NBC made deals with iTunes for downloads, CBS made deals with Comcast for video  on demand.&nbsp; The networks challenged the  cable industry, which draws revenue from both advertising and subscription,  with the demand they pay a subscription fee for network programs- no longer  would retransmission be free. </p>
    <p>Virtually every bit of programming  the networks come up with is now designed for initial use on a television set  and then the digital world. It is no longer enough to have the best or most  popular show on during the prime-time hours every night; it is essential that  viewers be given opportunities to locate the shows they want to watch at any  time. </p>
    <p>At the 'upfronts'  the five networks announced experimental plans&nbsp; to hold viewers' attention during  commercials. They are inserting games, quizzes and mini dramas into breaks.  Products are being integrated into plots for the show; two experimental  programs without traditional commercial breaks will premiere in the US  this fall.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>NBC announced several formats  including creating a single commercial that lasts for  an entire break and developing story-lines that run through the ads. To enhance  their pitch, they enlisted the presence of Jerry Seinfeld who is to feature in  short video clips to promote his animated film, <em>Bee Movie, </em>during programming. </p>
    <p>The most frequent experiment is to  insert original content into commercial breaks and use network stars to pitch  ads, as seen on <em>Desperate Housewives</em> and <em>Ugly Betty</em>.&nbsp; Fox created an animated taxi driver, Oleg, to  appear in breaks talking to his passengers. He has gained quite a following. <em>Court TV</em> offered a news story about an  unsolved murder with clues dropped in commercial breaks online and via text  messages.&nbsp; The game's winner won $25,000  which gave incentive to watch. Fans of NBC's <em>Scrubs</em> were asked trivia questions at the beginning of a commercial  break with the answer appearing between ads. Real ads are being played on  television sets in the show and there are experiments with &ldquo;cwickies&rdquo;,  5 second ads that come together in a longer ad by evening's end.</p>
    <p>All this creativity aims to stop  viewers with digital video recorders from fast forwarding through  advertisements. The Nielsen Media Research Company is offering ratings for  commercial breaks instead of just the shows around them. Nielsen estimates that  in prime time nearly half the 18 to 49 year old viewers are watching recorded  programs and of these, six in 10 skip through the ads. This means a lot of  missed opportunities for marketers.</p>
    <p>With such a volatile marketplace,  the traditional advertising agency is changing. Publishers are creating their  own in-house ad agencies planning alternative ways to create contagion, ways  which don't involve television. The new advertising landscapes include<em> YouTube</em> videos you watch on your cell, Bluetooth billboards that flash you private  messages, and online fantasy worlds you wander in for hours. Smart agencies are  creating ads online that people actually seek out for fun, then pass on to  friends: the 'stealth, viral ad' is a branded Internet film like a TV  commercial, but without the 30 second time limit. They spread<strong> </strong>via e-mail, blogs,  and word of mouth. The 'webisode' is a short sitcom  with a branded message. The 'consumer generated commercial' is an ad made by  the people for the people. </p>
    <p>There are long-form interactive,  viral campaigns that draw viewers in for weeks at a time. The 'mashup' is a branded site that lets consumers mix and match  multiple digital media -video music, animation - often for a contest. There are  helpful online service websites (called &ldquo;free services&rdquo;) with video board  updates from cheap, sponsored, winter sporting events, and music tracks to  download from artists. Jeep Uncharted is the best example. 'The addictive time  suck' is the name given to interactive games, quizzes, and 'pass-it-on tricks'  that are irresistible - even when you don't like the brand they are promoting.  A Budweiser site lets you craft apologies to girlfriends, boyfriends and  relatives and have a robotic voice delivered them via cellphone.</p>
    <p><strong><em>On-line's growth is inexorable,  an advertising gold mine to be tapped&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong></p>
    <p>When television began no one could  have envisioned the thousands of satellite channels and DVDs that would some  day emerge as viewing options. Similarly no one is sure of the ways by which  the Internet will change our lives and where online advertising is headed. The <em>YouTube</em> and <em>MySpace</em> fans are  angry at ad agencies for co-opting the Internet's democratizing space to shill  for the big companies. Eventually, these new agencies say brands will be at the  forefront of total digital integration, the merging of your mobile phone, your  computer screen, your TV, and the world outside. </p>
    <p>Every thing old is new again.  Stuart Elliott<em> (The </em><em>New York</em><em> Times</em>,&nbsp; 13/6/07) pointed out that  'branded entertainment', which is new to contemporary advertisers, was a  mainstay of marketing from the 30s through to the 60s. Back then sponsors were  featured in the title, like the <em>Bell  Telephone Hour</em> or <em>Lux</em><em> Radio Theatre</em>.&nbsp; It faded because it became too expensive for  individual sponsors to finance full production of a series. And questions arose  over undue manipulation of quiz shows at the behest of advertisers, a lesson  that should not be forgotten.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>A coming series <em>Mad Men (</em>which ironically, is about the  advertising industry and those who chose it as a career, circa 1960), will  feature Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey on and off the show. Just as cigarettes  became embedded in popular movies of the 40's and 50's, Jack Daniel's will be  embedded in every aspect of the series. Characters will drink the whiskey in  various scenes or ask for the brand by name, sets will be decorated with  vintage bottles, decanters and ads.&nbsp;  Executives associated with advertising and public relations campaigns  for Jack Daniels will be among the industry figures interviewed for short  segments about 'ad legends' past and present.&nbsp;  And Jack Daniels will be featured in promotions asking viewers to watch  the series, as well as in brief vignettes to introduce commercials that the  network is calling &ldquo;mad advertising&rdquo;.&nbsp;  Off the show, Jack Daniel's will be the sponsor of the &ldquo;Mad Men&rdquo; section  of the AMC cable Web site and will be credited on posters, print ads and other  materials intended to encourage viewers to tune in. </p>
    <p>Despite such efforts television is  dragging its feet as the online industry embraces the opportunities presented  by advertising. </p>
    <p>In the old days of the dot-com era  online ads were simple billboards on a website placed in the hope that visitors  would notice them. The process of delivering relevant, search-based ads- <em>Google's</em> bread  and butter- is comparatively easy. A typed search term sets off related text  ads which appear next to the results, exposing consumers to sundry generally  relevant advertisers. But faster and cheaper computing and sophisticated  software algorithms are making advertising more intelligent and measurable. Quants have become a force in the advertising industry.  Online's growth is inexorable, an advertising gold mine to be tapped and <em>Google</em>is a front-runner.&nbsp; Searching accounts for only about 5% of the  time people spend online; the other 95% is spent on the wider Web where a  different advertising landscape looms. There is the Internet's equivalent of  glossy magazine ads or television commercials, typically the province of brand  advertisers like Nike and BMW.&nbsp; This is  the next big online opportunity where advertising can reach specific audiences  in ways not seen before.</p>
    <p>The goal, according to Steve Lohr<em> (New York Times</em>,  May 16) is to refine the process to deliver select audiences, of thousands,  even millions to mass marketers through behavioral targeting, social networking  algorithms, predictive economics and other mathematical strategies, trying to  work out which ads work, with the idea of advertising only to prime customers.</p>
    <p>Behaviorial  targeting tracks, analyses and predicts online&nbsp; behaviour  based on where you have gone before on the Internet. So if you recently visited  sports and auto Web sites, and read global warming articles on news sites, you  would mostly most likely turn out to be an 18- to 45-year-old male.&nbsp; An algorithm would then determine that you would  be a good candidate for an ad about Toyota's  hybrid-electric Prius. If you have clicked on a few  banner ads about dieting or purchased a book about carbohydrates you will be  considered a good target for diet products. Advertisers are willing to pay high  rates to reach such screened audiences. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>With online advertising's growth  accelerating, the four giants of the web have invested more than $10 billion in  two months (April/ May) to buy businesses that control how ads are bought, sold  and displayed across the Internet. <em>Google</em> paid $3.1 million for <em>DoubleClick</em> which specializes in  software for display ads. Microsoft announced it would acquire Seattle  online advertising and marketing firm<em> aQuantive</em> for $6 million.<em> Yahoo</em> recently bought the 80% of <em>Right Media </em>that it did not already own, for $680 million.</p>
    <p>The sites that draw the most  traffic - <em>Google</em><em>, Yahoo, Microsoft's MSN </em>and<em> AOL</em> - are now competing, not just for  traffic to their own home pages, but for the advertising they display on behalf  of other sites. These large Internet companies want to become intermediaries  connecting advertisers to the millions of Web sites that have fragmented the  online audience with their online video games, cell-phones and Internet  television services. There are scores of small innovative companies that are  behind this revolution on Madison Avenue. </p>
    <p>According to Miguel Helft, (<em> New York  Times, </em>May 19) these recent deals are &ldquo;blurring the lines between the big  Internet companies and&nbsp; traditional  advertising companies like the Omnicom Group, WPP Group and Publicis  Groupe,&nbsp;  potentially bringing them into conflict&rdquo;&nbsp;  Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners, a leading  advertising agency based in the San Francisco Bay area predict brands will  become the new networks, making advertising agencies more like Hollywood  producers and branded entertainment just one of many options. </p>
    <p><strong><em>TV is playing catch up.</em></strong></p>
    <p>The fear that these new  partnerships will accelerate the migration of brand advertisers and diminish  their revenues has prompted television Networks to diversify in an attempt to  catch up. The first big deal to be announced following the &ldquo;upfronts'  (<em>New York Times</em> , June 14) is between  the NBC Universal division of the General Electric Company and the Media  Agencies of the WPP Group. The agreement is valued in excess of $800 million and  includes NBC, Telemundo and Broadcast TV networks, as  well as cable networks Bravo, Sci-Fi and USA.  It includes all parts of the television schedule - daytime, late-night and news  programs, in addition to prime time - along with digital operations like nbc.com  as well as branded entertainment elements integrating products into the plots  of the shows. Every opportunity to profile products will be taken. </p>
    <p>NBC is developing a Web Site for  students called <em>iCue</em>(IQ), intended to engage teachers and  students and woo a generation of potential viewers to NBC News (which will be  delivered on electronic devices from laptops to cell-phones). NBC's Bravo  channel has ambitious plans to cash in on its shows including <em>Top Chef, Shear Genius, Top Design </em>and <em>The Real Housewives of Orange County</em> with branded books and licensed merchandise ranging from cutlery to gym  clothes. Bravo Media has forged an alliance with a talent management company to  oversee the careers of chefs, hairstyles, designers and others who compete on its  reality contest shows, as well as ordinary people who become stars in  docudramas such as <em>Work Out</em>.&nbsp; No opportunity will be missed. </p>
    <p>As broad-band penetration  increases, making it easier to watch video clips online, online video is  becoming a significant advertising medium.&nbsp;  TV series are being shortened to five minutes for viewing on a PC. This  is one way for <em>My Space,</em> (the social  networking Web now owned by News Corp), to generate revenue. Honda will be the  sole sponsor of what Sony Pictures television is calling the Minisode Network launched in June. Visitors to the website  are able to watch episodes of 15 Vintage Sony series, including <em>Charlie's Angels, TheFacts  of Life, </em><em>Fantasy</em><em>Island</em> and <em>Who's</em><em> the Boss? </em>edited from their original  30-60 minutes. Honda will run a two second commercial appearing before the  shortened episode starts. Eventually these minisodes  will be available on cell-phones.</p>
    <p>Indeed cell-phones are seen by  some as the future. Forrester Research reported (<em>New York Times</em>, June 17,   2007) cell-phones rank higher than television in the 18-26 age  group and media executives are hoping it will have a large appetite for mobile  video content. When asked which device they felt they could not live without,  38% of this age group said they could not do without their computer and 28 %  said they could not do without their cell-phone.( This is the group that lined  up to buy <em>Apple's</em> iPhone).  Only 18 % mentioned television first. Young dexterous fingers, combined with  good eyesight make cell-phones the technology of the young; the Baby Boomers  prefer their television on bigger and bigger screens but they are not the main  audience the advertisers seek. </p>
    <p>The media companies' response to such&nbsp; data is to make  plans to transmit full hour episodes of shows like <em>Lost</em> and <em>Grey's Anatomy</em> on cell-phones. Whether the demand will be there to view programming on a  mobile device with a tiny screen is yet to be seen but some are banking on it.  ESPN - the sporting channel - is confident this is what viewers will want. A CBS  viewer survey&nbsp; learned  64% of 18-24 year olds watch television with their cell phones nearby. CBS sees  the cell-phone as the substitute when viewers are not near their TV sets and  before long, as people are more mobile, they will want mobile content.</p>
    <p><strong><em>New media are providing the means  for the media savvy generation to experience what they want most out of media,  while avoiding mainstream television.</em></strong></p>
    <p>This is a new media dawn, and this  is television in the competitive world of the Internet and the mobile Web. But  there are dangers for the Networks. Advertisements now take up 16 minutes per  hour on network TV. It is a most frustrating and irritating experience watching  American television with its barrage of interruptions. Much is execrable and  Americans have had enough.&nbsp; In a 2006  poll by Interpret LLC, 56% of Americans said they would fast forward through  every television commercial if they could.</p>
    <p>So network advertising is going to  have to be extremely clever to capture an audience for whom  content may just not be king. <em>Yahoo </em>CEO  Terry Semel lost his job in June, asunder his leadership <em>Yahoo</em> focused on partnerships with Hollywood,  believing content was the key to success. Its rival <em>Google</em>focused on technology and pulled way ahead; it was the search  engineering that proved more attractive to advertisers.</p>
    <p>We are told repeatedly that media  is a conduit; television, radio or web sites simply deliver content in some  form. But increasingly content is itself becoming a medium; one for interaction  and a means of connecting with others. The young generation is the connected  generation; media is their social currency. Their use of cell-phones and SMS, iPods and the Web has driven new and unanticipated  developments in communication. They are harder to track, they are media savvy,  and they are cynical about advertising. Increasingly they are making lifestyle  choices that are environmentally friendly; they are changing the ways they  consume.</p>
    <p>As marketers revive branded  entertainment and bury products within the content of television shows to blur  the line between advertising and programming, they take a risk. They are up  against the most media literate consumers in history who are cynical about  marketing ploys, place a premium on transparency and are unlikely to take kindly  to seeing characters spruiking products in the middle  of their programs.&nbsp; Programmers and  advertisers must move fast, and think smart to attract the young but they will  not succeed unless they understand the new culture in which they are working.</p>
    <p>Google  epitomizes this culture in so many ways. Its young inventors are exploring the  production of affordable, clean-burning fuel; wireless access around the world;  googling your genes. Bill Gates has stepped down and  Sergey and Larry are the new generation dreaming dreams my generation could  never have contemplated. They have stepped into Microsoft's shoes as the power  that needs to be fettered charged with confusing advertising with information  content online. But that is exactly what television is doing increasingly to  salvage its content business.</p>
    <p>In Silicon Valley young software  developers eat, drink and talk code at advertised 12 hour programming parties  (open to the public) every six weeks or so. Dozens of people attend these  informal gatherings dubbed DevHouse. The organizers  say they are trying to resurrect the spirit of &ldquo;the Homebrew Computer Club,&rdquo;  the legendary 70's garage gathering of Steve Jobs, Steve Wosniak  and other founders of computer companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;  (<em>San Jose</em><em> Mercury</em> 17/6/07) They are reaching out to like minded others to  communicate in a changing world.</p>
    <p>New York  media ecologist, Douglas Rushkoff (<em>Get Back in the Box</em>, Collins 2005) says,  &ldquo;The best reason people purchase stuff in a networked culture&hellip; is to share it  with other people... The many forms of content we collect and experience online  - from images and videos to music files and clever opinion pieces&hellip; are excuses  to send an e-mail, or something to have when the conversation goes quiet at  work&hellip;People will share anything they've got &hellip;in order to make contact with  others.&rdquo; Rushkoff believes the every-man-for-himself  ethic of consumerism is giving way to a desire for community and connectedness,  particularly in the face of drought, global warming and evidence of our need to  live together. In evidence he cites the number of college students volunteering  since 9/11, which has grown by more than 20%.</p>
    <p>New programs on network television  infused and surrounded by selling pitches are not the main game in this  culture. People want more. In this interconnected world there is some evidence  that the generation we as parents have worried about, because of their  immersion in media, may be the ones to outsmart the media.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;In the changing media culture there is a  chicken and egg problem for television to resolve. The medium requires a lot of  money to produce its hits. Even with diversification into all forms of content  transmission, they rely on selling products for their revenue. Advertising is  intrusive and annoying and the more of it that is inflicted on consumers, the  audience wants and <em>will</em> find ways to  avoid its impact. New media are providing the means for the media savvy  generation to experience what they want most, out of media, while avoiding  mainstream television. As digital television will fragment media more, why  would the young generation return to the big screen? </p>
    <p>The moments  when television captures the attention and imagination of its audience are very  few. With drama, the final episode of <em>The  Sopranos</em> was one such moment. A nation talked about what would happen and  what did happen on the front pages of the press around the US.  There was passion, anger and delight, and the creative choices the writer made  were national news and domestic and workplace conversation for days after the  final episode aired. Can you imagine the effect on a creative writer when  ordered to script a character like Tony Soprano with a line to his wife like: &ldquo;Carmela I'll put on my Nikes, go pick up my <em>New Jersey Times</em>, take my Toyota Prius and meet AJ at McDonalds&rdquo;. </p>
    <p>Television rarely offers the best  of what it is capable. But it is a medium that demands risks be taken if the  fleeing viewers are to be recaptured. If chopping up and recycling content  along with rampant commercialism are the best solutions television executives  can come up with, the medium will die.</p>
    <p>In Australia  we work in a time warp, waiting for the Networks in the US  to take the risks with programming and advertising that will sort out our own  media fate. Our television networks have announced the US  programs they have snared following the 'upfronts' (<em>The Australian</em> July 2nd) -  programs they can buy more cheaply than making their own. This approach has  worked in the past but now carries bigger risks.&nbsp; The US  networks beat the bushes for ideas to solve their problems,  there has never been a time when the creation of a successful program stood  more chance of adaptation in the US.  But embracing change has not been the way the television industry has worked in  Australia. Nor  do we find innovation in the production industry in Australia  with its bureaucratic processes and copycat programming. TiVo,  the on-demand digital television recording pioneer, and Australian broadcaster  Seven Media Group, plan to bring the service to Australia  and New Zealand  starting next year. Australians, we can be sure, will work to avoid the ads as  Americans do. And the media companies will try to trick consumers into watching  advertisements in any way they can.</p>
    <p>Ours is a world different from one  ever known or imagined before. Darwin's  evolutionary theory demonstrated you adapt or you die.&nbsp; Newspaper revenues are plummeting as readers  flock to the Internet for information, advertisers head to Craig's list (an  online community that began in 1994 as a simple listing of local events by a  San Franciscan, Craig Newman, to about 20 of his friends and now serves more  than 120 cities) because Craig does not believe everything has to be about  money and people trust Craig more than the classifieds. The television audience  is down. (The Director of research at Australia's  biggest media agency Mitchell and Partners confirms the same pattern of viewer  loss to television is occurring in Australia  as in the US.  The number of 25-54 year olds watching prime time commercial television has  slumped 16% since 2002).&nbsp; <em>YouTube</em> page  views are up.&nbsp; People have stopped buying  CDs in favour of downloading on<em> iTunes</em>. There is growing scorn for the  mass media that lionizes and demonizes Paris Hilton, Lindsey Lohan and Britney Spears and for journalists who helped decide  to bomb Iraq.<br />
        Networks are  grasping for a way to grow profits in the Internet age and satisfy advertisers'  needs. Advertising is predicted to remain strong but is increasingly seen as  manipulative, dishonest and a ubiquitous irritant; the business needs to market  itself much more effectively than it does. And in a country where three of the  Republican presidential candidates have stated they don't believe in evolution,  and half the country believes in 'intelligent design', creative adaptation to  technological change is slow. There is an assumption in Middle   America that television will go on in much the way it always has.  In Australia we  are more interested in the ratings battle between Networks 7 and 9, than what  will happen to television when the Baby Boomers have moved on and the young  media savvy generation is the mainstream. <br />
        &nbsp;While Silicon Valley  cannot be said to represent the US,  its residents <em>are</em> determining the  changes that will affect us all. As a result television, along with those media  companies which are unable to embrace innovation and adapt fast enough to  contribute to this technological revolution, serving the needs of consumers  rather than exploiting them, will go the way of the dinosaurs. </p>
