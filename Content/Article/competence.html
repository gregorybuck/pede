    <b>Leadership in  Boys' Education – National Forum</b>
    <p>Newcastle, 13 May, 1998</p>
    <p>Men have had a bad press in recent times and I want, in this  address, to indicate some of the reasons why, but also to suggest that we're  not as stupid as we are often portrayed. You, as the educators of boys, need to  capitalise on the positive signs of change and ensure the men of the future are  more emotionally intelligent than their forbears.</p>
    <p>"Men  always want to be a woman's first love: women have a more subtle instinct: what  they like is to be a man's last romance."</p>
    <p>You all know the litany of problems: men can't communicate  their feelings, they don't read the signs of marital breakdown before it's too  late, they don't know their own children, they won't go to the doctor for a  regular check-up and thus die earlier than women of heart problems, skin  cancers, etc. </p>
    <p>As the cartoons (overheads) suggest, men are unaware of the  emotional needs of their partners (husband reading the newspaper, wife sitting  stark naked next to him and he asks, vaguely:<em>"Any plans for this evening, hon.?"); </em>wife doing the dishes,  husband watching TV, calling out<em>: "By the  way, hon., great food, great wine, great you."; </em>man sitting at restaurant  table unaware that his partner is leaving, burbling on: <em>"The sound of violins, the night, the wine, the ambience – but most of  all, Louise, you!").</em> Men are also too often absent from their children  (couple in bed, child standing there next to them, he says in surprise<em>: "I thought it was just one of those bad  dreams, but apparently, honey, we have a kid.")</em> And their adjustment to the  changed circumstances of women in society is still somewhat stilted. (All-male  managers' group, responding to a female manager's report: "<em>That was a fine report, Barbara. But since the sexes speak different  languages, I probably didn't understand a word of it."; </em>wife responding to  husband<em>: "No, I don't think our marriage  would benefit from a mission statement.")</em></p>
    <p>Now all of this is true, to an extent. Boys are brought  up to hide their feelings, not to disclose too much to their rivals, never to  admit weakness. But that has been pretty functional. After all, it has been a  man's world out there, and if you're a wimp, the others don't give you any  quarter. In fact, the research on male-female differences shows that girls are  more attuned to feelings and their nuances than are boys, they are better at  detecting fleeting feelings in the faces of other people, and they do tend to  experience the same feeling that another person in their company feels.  However, where people are deliberately trying to conceal their true feelings,  there is no difference in the ability of men and women in reading the  situation; and there is no difference when they are asked to sense the unstated  thoughts of someone in an ongoing encounter. The more emotional leakage there  is (via words, body language, as well as facial expression) the better men  become at reading the emotions of others. Their empathic accuracy is equal to  that of women.</p>
    <p>So the nonsense perpetrated in books such as Gray's <em>Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus,</em> is really just a cheap play on the surface differences. As you know, on all  psychological characteristics, the bell curves have immense overlap; the  within-group differences are larger than the between-group differences. And  empathic accuracy (Ickes, 1997) is very important in the business arena, where  people often have good reason to conceal their true feelings, and being able to  read the signs accurately is crucial in clinching a deal, selling or  negotiating something, where it's harder to control all the channels of  expression. So there is no evidence of a 'female intuition' advantage. Men have  as much latent ability for empathy, but usually less motivation to be empathetic,  than women. They are trained to conceal, to be cool, not to 'seem' sensitive,  because sensitivity in a macho world is a sign of weakness. If women are  prompted to prove that empathy is a hallmark of feminine identity, they make  more effort. It's the image men wish to convey, not their lack of empathic  ability or accuracy, that makes the difference.</p>
    <p>It's also a myth that men don't communicate with their  wives/partners. They may not do so as much as, or in quite the ways, their  partners would like, but most men insist that their 'best mate' (usually seen  as a male bonding term) is 'me missus'. In my research for the book <em>Men, Mateship, Marriage </em>(Harper Collins,  1997), I found across all socio-economic groups that the one person men could  disclose their real feelings to was their partner.</p>
    <p>You may wonder why I'm talking about empathy and reading  emotions. To put it bluntly, without such skills, no-one, including men, would  survive, and in the world of the global marketplace, emotional intelligence is  rapidly taking over from problem-solving and adaptability as the key skill for  success. In this I am drawing from Daniel Goleman's (1997) book <em>Emotional Intelligence: Why it can Matter  More than IQ.</em></p>
    <p>You may recall the Stanford   University experiments of the  1960s, where Walter Mischel gave children the 'Marshmallow Test'. Put simply,  the experimenter placed a marshmallow on the table in front of the child; he  then said he was leaving the room for a short while; the child could eat the  marshmallow, but if they could wait, then they would be given two. Some kids  couldn't wait and immediately ate the marshmallow. The others delayed,  sometimes with great difficulty, but were rewarded with two marshmallows. It's  simply a delay of gratification test. But what was significant was that, many  years later, the 'two marshmallow kids' had done significantly better than the  others on school achievement, entry into college, job placement, etc. The kids  who had grabbed the one that was there were more likely to have failed, become  delinquent, teenage pregnant, jobless, and so on. Goleman sees this test as an  indicator of being in touch with your own emotions, able to 'read' a situation  accurately, which stood the one group in good stead for the rest of their  lives.</p>
    <p>You will notice that I am not talking of emotional  intelligence in  terms of getting boys to  love their fathers, or men to hug trees. I'm talking about a real skill that  must be, and can be, learned for dealing with life's social demands. Another  example is the true story of the pilot coming in to land in Portland,   Oregon, with the landing gear stuck. He was  a man with a violent temper who would brook no opposition to his authority. So  while he fiddled with the controls, his crew failed to point out that the fuel  gauge was nearing empty. The plane crashed and all crew and passengers lost  their lives. Anger, fear, denial of communication can have fatal results, and  it is this that boys and men need to be taught.</p>
    <p>There are two closely related elements to emotional intelligence,  variously called intra- and inter-personal intelligence (Howard Gardner),  social and emotional competence, emotional literacy, and inter-personal skills.  They are self-insight and empathy. Salovey &amp; Meyer (1990) describe it as  "being able to monitor and regulate one's own and others' feelings, and to use  feelings as a guide to thought and action." In other words, it is an applied  skill, not just a vague emotional capacity. Goleman (1998) in his second book, <em>Working With Emotional Intelligence,</em> describes it as "the capacity for recognising our own feelings and those of  others, and for managing emotions well in ourselves and in our relationships."  Again, the stress is on using the skills of social and emotional competence. </p>
    <p>Time will not permit much further detail, but there are five  essential elements involved, and they can be, are, and should be taught to boys  and girls in the home, the school and (if they have missed out) in the  workplace: </p>
    <ol>
        <li><u>Self-awareness</u>: knowing what we feel in a  situation; using this to guide decision-making; realistic self-assessment and  self-confidence.  (As an aside, it's  pointless to try and teach self-esteem, if children have no competences to be  proud of. Empty praise for worthless effort is soon seen as phoney.)</li>
        <li><u>Self</u>-<u>regulation</u>: the ability to  delay gratification to achieve goals; using emotions to facilitate, not  interfere with, the task at hand; being conscientious and persevering;  recovering well from distress, being resilient.</li>
        <li><u>Motivation</u>: self-guidance towards goals;  taking the initiative; striving to improve; persevering in the face of setbacks  and frustrations. (Again, we do students a disservice if we let then think  anything worthwhile can be achieved without real effort. They need to  experience the joy of 'flow', the exhilaration of becoming lost in a task which  requires deep concentration.)</li>
        <li><u>Empathy</u>: sensing what other people are  feeling: the ability to take their perspective; cultivating rapport with a  broad diversity of people. (The Pauline Hansons of this world will not win –  this is an essential element of the post-modern world, where respect for  diversity is the only way to draw from its strengths.)</li>
        <li><u>Social skills</u>: handling your own emotions  well in situations; reading social situations accurately; interacting smoothly  and effectively; using these skills to persuade and lead, negotiate and settle  disputes, for cooperation and teamwork.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
    <p>It should be clear that we are not talking about getting  boys and men to be 'more expressive', to 'let it all hang out', to 'shed a tear  now and then', though there's nothing wrong with that in its place. We are  talking about a crucial social skill, one that is essential in any social  interaction, whether that be a marriage partnership, a workplace team or a  community organisation. </p>
    <p>Emotional intelligence can be taught, and it should be  incorporated as part of the curriculum from early childhood education on. There  is no need to push it as an extra curriculum subject, though that is what many  US schools are now doing. They call it 'Self Science', or 'Social and Emotional  Learning'; examples are the Yale Social Competence Program and the Oakland  Child Development Project. Every sensible teacher incorporates such lessons in  every classroom, but it would do no harm for parents and teachers to be made  more conscious of how important such procedures are, compared with a strictly  cognitive approach to teaching and learning. They should encourage  assertiveness, as opposed to aggression or passivity; active listening;  self-awareness (the 'Emotions Cube' is one way of doing this in a group, a  classroom or a workshop with executives); recognising your own strengths and  weaknesses, the consequences of alternative choices; empathy, respecting and  taking account of other people's feelings; good relationships and communication  skills; the ability to negotiate conflict (the SOCS  Stoplight – Situation, Options, Consequences,  Solutions - is one technique).</p>
    <p>But emotional intelligence needs to be incorporated into the  school as a whole, as an organisation, permeating their entire culture. We know  from the research that a sense of belonging, of connectedness gives meaning and  security to children's lives, yet how often do we design our schools and  classrooms to be inclusive of everyone? Why can't we have home rooms, fewer  teachers to cover more subjects so young students feel a few adults really know  them? Why can't we have group learning instead of competitive, individualised  tests of achievement, cross- age teams and tutoring? The hidden curriculum carries  potent messages to students too: how lessons are taught, how 'discipline' is  handled; the teacher as a role model in emotional competence; the inclusion or  exclusion of parents; consistency across classrooms, the playground, the  cafeteria; the school campus as a 'caring community' where kids feel respected,  needed, included, valued, and bonded to teachers, fellow students and the  school itself? (as compared with the recent Columbine   High School massacre, where 'jocks'  were valued over all others, and little was done to include the alienated,  excluded groups).</p>
    <p>For teachers and school principals who resist the notion  that they have a responsibility for the emotional wellbeing of their students  (most often expressed in more acceptable terms, such as, "I can't be a mother  or social worker to every child!"), my message is, you are already, you can't  avoid it, and it is every teacher's responsibility to nurture the child's  growing emotional intelligence as much as their cognitive skills. Every piece  of research on effective childhood socialisation comes back to the model shown  here in four cells: Where parental/adult affect, support, emotional involvement  with the child is high, and clear limits are set for the child's behaviour, we  see the best results – this is 'authoritative' parenting. But where parents are  too warm and limits are too lax, we get permissive child-rearing; almost as  harmful in its own way as 'authoritarian' parenting where warmth is low and  limit-setting is too strict. The fourth cell, combining low support/warmth and  low limit-setting leaves the poor child totally confused.; he doesn't know  whether he is loved or what is permitted. If parents and teachers all applied  these simple principles in practice they and the children would be a much  happier lot than they are today. Indeed, many parents have little time for  consistent parenting because of long work hours; others are angry and  distressed because they have no work at all, or not enough to keep the family  together.</p>
    <p>"<em>As family life no longer  offers growing numbers of children a sure footing in life, schools are left as  the one place communities can turn to for correctives to children's  deficiencies in emotional and social intelligence. That is not to say that  schools alone can stand in for all the social institutions that too often are  in or nearing collapse. But since virtually every child goes to school, it  offers a place to reach children with basic lessons for living that they may  never get otherwise. Emotional literacy implies an expanded mandate for  schools, taking up the slack for failing families in socializing children. This  daunting task requires two major changes: that teachers go beyond their  traditional mission, and that people in the community become more involved in  schools."</em></p>
    <p>Most of you will know of the Health-Promoting Schools  movement, or of the model of the 'full service school'. This is the way of the  future and schools must end their silo mentality and become more closely linked  with parents, community support services and the business community if they are  to stay relevant to the needs of children in the next century.</p>
    <p>The critical points are those of transition between  primary and secondary school, and the transition to puberty. They are turning  points in a child's path towards competent adulthood, and a central goal of  schooling should be to ensure clear lessons are learned about the self and  others. We know in particular that the pathway of boys to violence includes  early impulsiveness and quickness to anger, an inability to pay attention,  becoming social rejects by end of grade school and bonding with a circle of  others like themselves, commencing crime sprees in the middle school years,  with a police record and readiness for expanding violence by early adulthood. It  is by changing the whole school, not by targeting individual children 'at  risk', that the most effective interventions can be made. That's what  leadership in boys' education is about – structuring the school environment so  it is inclusive and emotionally intelligent as a learning community.</p>
    <p>The emotional bedrock of character is self-discipline, and  schools should not shrink from teaching and demanding this quality in every  child. The old-fashioned notion of 'will' is basically an ability to defer  gratification and channel one's urges to act. No society can survive without  people who have that will. The ability to put aside our self-centered focus  opens the way to empathy, real listening, caring, altruism and compassion; it  breaks down stereotypes and breeds tolerance – all capacities increasingly  called on in our pluralistic society. They are the basic arts of democracy and  commitment to civic and moral values.</p>
    <p>To conclude, they are also the skills most essential and  increasingly valued in the world of work. So I am not saying kids should be  taught emotional intelligence simply to make them better people or to make  schools nicer places to be. Remember my earlier example of the angry airline  pilot. The cockpit is a microcosm of any working organisation, and "Stress  makes people stupid". Whereas the jungle fighter was the boss of old, the  virtuoso in inter-personal skills is the corporate future. Valuing diversity,  networking effectively, team-building, airing criticism constructively are all  critical to high performance and productivity. </p>
    <p>As Goleman notes (p. 314) "Farsighted companies are  realising that they, too, have a stake in how well schools are educating their  future workers ... envision coalitions among local governments, schools, and  business aimed at boosting the collective level of emotional intelligence in  the community." In the global age, most work will be stitched together by each  individual according to his/her skills and the demand for them. Some 77% of all  US 'knowledge workers' already decide what they will do on the job, they are  not told by others. Increasingly, people will do work, not have a job; they  will work in virtual teams to meet needs, solve problems, utulising a  specialised mix of talent and expertise. "Autonomy can only work if it goes  hand in hand with self-control, trustworthiness and conscientiousness. And as  people work less 'for the company', and more for themselves, emotional  intelligence will be required to maintain the relationships vital for workers'  survival."</p>
    <p>The signs are promising that employers and men in general  are gradually getting the point. These are not simply 'soft options'; they  affect directly the effectiveness of every individual in the home, in the  schools and in the workplace. In companies I deal with to help design a more  healthy workplace culture I no longer see the surprise expressed by the boss in  this last cartoon. "<em>It has come to my  attention that you have a life outside the office!" </em>In the New Links  Workplace of the future, one would hope the boys have become whole men, in  touch with their own feelings and abilities and fully able to cooperate  effectively with others.</p>
