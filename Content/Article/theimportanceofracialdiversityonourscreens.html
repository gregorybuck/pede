            Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, who have raised their daughter to be an
            independent thinker. Still, they are unprepared for the shock when she arrives
            home with an African-American fiancé, a doctor played by Sidney Poitier. The

            We know
            prejudice dies hard and is manifest in both overt and subtle institutional
            forms. Ignoring the creativity of diverse groups in society is a symptom of
            discrimination. These new films suggest progress but many other groups are
