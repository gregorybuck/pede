        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>The ABC has announced a joint venture with
Dreamworld on the Gold Coast to launch ABC KIDS World, featuring&nbsp;<i>Giggle
and Hoot</i>, T<i>he Wiggles</i>,&nbsp;<i>Play School</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Bananas
in Pyjamas </i>in &quot;a new funpark to bring the ABC KIDS brand to life and
extend the experience&quot;. Why would we be surprised, given the progressive
commercialisation and exploitation of ABC children's programming across two
decades?</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>The slippery slide away from quality as a
priority began when the&nbsp;<i>Bananas</i>&nbsp;were spun off from&nbsp;<i>Play
School</i>&nbsp;to support a suite of merchandise to sell for profit. From that
point the merchandising tail has wagged the dog. If you have the resources, as
a public broadcaster, to keep churning out programs and screening them daily,
eventually they command attention. It has worked for trains, pigs,
cabbage-patch dolls, pink dinosaurs and even thongs and Teletubbies that can't
talk properly.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>The Friends of the ABC have rightly called the ABC to account,
describing the Fun Park as &quot;tacky&quot; and accusing it of &quot;using its
trusted name to make money out of children&quot;. It seems programming has
become all about marketing and branding, as the ABC struggles to hold on in the
face of technological change and diminishing funding.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>Kids are demonstrating a mind and dexterity of their own, leading
the media away from traditional programming and delivery models, as they
embrace the digital space. They have moved on to gaming, chat rooms, Facebook,
Instagram, SMS and the joys of online content they create themselves. They know
what they want, how they will engage with content, and they know where they can
get it.&nbsp;</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>The response is to grab them young, by every means possible, and
try to hold on to them. But exhibiting characters on televisions, computers,
radios, tablets, and mobiles in kids' homes, bedrooms, cars and schools, and
branding their baby bottles, bedding and &nbsp;lunch boxes, still isn't enough
to hold their attention. So if kids can interact with and see the characters,
perhaps they will stay relevant. Ultimately, with enterprise, it may be possible
to micro-chip kids as soon as they're born. The government could sell off the
rights to help reduce debt - and just think how much could be saved on
marketing!</span>

        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>Richard Finlayson, the ABC's director of television, appointed in
April 2013, spoke of the challenges he was facing just two months after his
appointment. &quot;Audiences are rapidly moving away from linear
schedules,&quot; he said. &quot;Over 50 per cent of viewing in the 18-24
demographic is already on-demand. It will be 80 per cent as early as 2017, and
older demographics are close behind.&quot;</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>Finlayson's solution was to show high-quality original Australian
content across four channels, iView and 13 partner platforms. It was a laudable
objective. But just how could that goal be achieved with declining audiences,
more hours to fill, and higher costs? Public broadcasting can only prop up
free-to-air so long as governments are willing to provide funds - and this is
under threat around the world.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>A television schedule is a voracious beast, so the
&quot;high-quality original&quot; children's television Finlayson called for
became something quite different. In 2009, the government was persuaded to
provide an extra $66.4 million over three years to build ABC3. When the ABC had
the opportunity to break new ground for an audience heavily engaged with new
media, it looked backwards by establishing a children's channel on a model more
than two decades old. The result is a demanding beast: two channels, ABC2
&amp; ABC3, to be scheduled from dawn to dark. Inevitably, they carry
predominantly high-volume, inexpensive, repeat programs from all over the
world. Characters with merchandising back-up predominate. Even adult drama is
now supported by merchandise where possible, not just books and DVDs which are
compatible, but fashion accessories such as scarves, handbags, and jewellery -
witness the &quot;Miss Fisher Collection&quot; based on costumes from the
series.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>A solution that apes commercial media leaves the ABC with no
raison d'etre. No one at the ABC is speaking about the value the public
broadcaster could bring to Australian children through a new model - through
innovation, promoting and sharing creativity, generating benefits to society
through collaboration with education.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>In order to attract children to relevant, appropriate material
that is designed with their best interests at heart, producers need to take
risks. We need innovative multi-platform services that accommodate games, chat
rooms, downloadable libraries, and opportunities to access, manipulate, create
and share multimedia content. They should have a global reach, for interaction
with other cultures. And they should engage with the education revolution.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>Education has always taken a hiding from free-to-air television
managers, who feared such a label would turn an audience off. Now with convergence,
search and interactivity, education and entertainment have come together and
kids have no problem with moving easily between the two domains on the same
technology. As a result, teaching and learning are being transformed, with
children enjoying taking the initiative in their learning.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>The solutions to public television's predicament may well lie in
its origins. When the Australian Government introduced television, we set out
the obligations of broadcasting. The medium was intended to inform, entertain
and benefit society. Public broadcasting was never seen as just another
entertainment business. It is an integral component in our education and
democratic political system.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>As a tool for the voice of children, as a tool for the education
of children, as a tool for cultural identity, the media is unequalled. Going
down the commercial road in pursuit of profits is an abdication of a national
responsibility to enrich our culture - and it will be the path to oblivion for
the ABC.</span>
