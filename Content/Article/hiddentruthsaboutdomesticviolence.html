<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>As head of
the new Royal Commission into family violence, Justice Marcia Neave faces quite
a challenge to find a 'solution'. What she will find at the outset is that data
to define the problem in the first place are missing. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>The Royal
Commission is charged with finding the most effective ways to 'prevent family
violence, improve early intervention, protect those most at risk, support
victims and make perpetrators more accountable'. The last three goals are
easier than the first two because they come after the violence is perpetrated.
The first two, however, are shrouded in obfuscation and political correctness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>The very
term domestic violence, even family violence, immediately puts the issue in the
realm of private life, a sacred domain of individual choice and family values
that imply outside interference is unwarranted. That is why reported figures
are doubtless lower than the probable reality. To 'prevent' implies getting
inside family life and/or a massive re-education program (about equality,
mutual respect, the respective rights and powers of men and women, the damage
done to children who witness violence). To 'support' will necessarily involve
some invasion of family privacy and the provision of more shelters or financial
and counselling support than are at present available.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>We know that
Australia-wide, 2% of women and 1% of men have experienced violence from a
current partner; 15% of women and 5% of men have experienced violence at the
hands of a former partner. That sounds low, yet in Victoria alone, there were
over 65,000 cases reported to police in 2013-14. Reporting has increased with
more social awareness, but other family members, neighbours, teachers, doctors
and others on the front line still under-report. Victims themselves are often
intimidated into silence by their partners so we have inadequate data to
indicate who is at most risk. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>We don't
even know (or want to talk about) who, which groups or individuals, need to be
protected or supported. The research does not categorise the incidence of
domestic violence in other than very broad terms. Patricia Easteal's 1996
research for the Institute of Family Studies found 43% of offenders were
'Australian', 7% Aboriginal, 15% Asian, 23% European, 5% Middle Eastern/African
and 4% Latin American. But <u>which</u> groups, ethnicities, religions within
Europe or Asia or elsewhere are unknown. Do Italians or Germans offend more or
less than the British? Do Chinese or Indians, Buddhists or Muslims treat their
women more violently? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>The latest
overview by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (2013, based on the 2012
Personal Safety Survey) breaks the figures down by gender, age group, State and
Disability, but not by ethnicity or religion. It categorises the experience of
violence by country of birth only in very broad terms (English-speaking, 0.8%,
Other countries 12.2%, Total born overseas 20.1%). The background of sexual
assault victims is also hard to unpack– Australia 16.2% in last 12 months, 3%
since age 15; Overseas (English-speaking 41.7% in last 12 months, 7.5% since
age 15; other languages 36.6% in last 12 months, 10.9% since age 15). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>The common
media image of a perpetrator as an uneducated, drunken Ocker male is just part
of the picture. But we tread on sensitive ground if we want to say women in
some ethnic groups, or some religions, even 'immigrants', are more 'at risk'
than others. Or to suggest part of the problem is that such women, now experiencing
life in a less gender-biased society, may be questioning and provoking anger in
their previously dominant menfolk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>We know that
20% of Aboriginal women experience violence compared with 7% of non-Aboriginal
women; they experience sexual assault at three times the rate of other women. It
often happens in public and is not reported to police. Warren Mundine, Chairman
of the Indigenous Advisory Council, recently called for an 'End to the
tiptoeing', saying one in every ten Aboriginal children has been removed from
parents in NSW, often because of domestic violence against both the mother and
the children. Yet discussion is impeded by a reluctance to ask what it is about
Aboriginal family culture (apart from an irreparable history of dispossession
and removal) that might explain it. Instead we 'pussyfoot' around the issue,
just as we do about saying some religions and ethnic groups view women as the
chattels of men, control them within domestic confines and resist any attempts
to change attitudes or protect those who are the victims.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Countless
research studies suggest that alcohol is involved in much domestic violence,
yet not every male perpetrator drinks alcohol. Moreover, we know that, even
when drunk, men usually acknowledge they stop before 'killing' their partner,
an indication that their violence is a deliberate act, not an unconscious or
uncontrollable one. Alcohol is not an adequate  explanation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Women who
are less well educated, or unemployed, experience more violence. So do young
women between the ages of 18-24. The incidence is higher during pregnancy
(36%), suggesting the male's 'right' to sex is under threat. It is higher in
remote and regional areas and for women with disabilities. Recent arrivals and
refugees suffer economic disadvantage, language barriers, lack community
support, don't know the laws and are often isolated and invisible in the home.
Yet the onset of abuse precedes their migration to Australia, and use of
alcohol is lower in such groups, so acceptance of violence has to be a cultural
issue as well as a situational one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Marcia Neave
will have to paddle strongly in these muddied waters if her Commission is to
come up with any solutions beyond what is already known. Bravely confronting some
taboos and hidden truths is one way to go.</span></p>
