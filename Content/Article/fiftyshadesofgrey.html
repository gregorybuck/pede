        <span style='font-family: inherit; color: black'>The
trilogy plays on the age-old fantasies women indulge about men. When I was a
teenager in the 1950s, magazines like&nbsp;<i>True Confessions</i>&nbsp;were
the vehicle. They assured me, &quot;Someday he'd come along, the man I love,
and he'd be big and strong, the man I love&quot;. My favourite film star was
Betty <span class="SpellE">Grable</span>, and I thought good legs would carry me far.
Cultural <span class="SpellE">artifacts</span> told my generation repeatedly that
when you married you lived happily ever after.&nbsp;</span>

        <span style='font-family: inherit; color: black'>Women
were encouraged to be submissive, to please the breadwinner, the dominant male.
Don't upset him. He owned you under a contract called marriage. His happiness
meant your happiness. Now, while we have learnt life's journey does not unfold
like that, and the rise of feminism blew apart the legitimacy of male
domination, how far have we really come? Sex for procreation has become sex for
recreation and that takes many forms.</span>

        <span style='font-family: inherit; color: black'>Back
to another taxi ride, in which I heard a radio report that police had to rescue
a woman spread-eagled on a bed tied to bed posts. Her unconscious partner,
dressed in a batman costume, had leapt off the wardrobe and hit his head. Is it
anybody else's business what happens in our bedroom? Is <i>Fifty Shades</i>&nbsp;just
harmless fun? Is it exciting to let your partner tie you up and spank you? Do
you go on a date, rush home to jump into &quot;the play room&quot; to be
whipped? &nbsp;Is this the modern way to have sex?</span>
    </p>

        <span style='font-family: inherit; color: black'>If
such &quot;play&quot; means sexual freedom, where do you go from here? What
happens a year from now in such a relationship? There is no reciprocation. She
doesn't tie him up and belt his backside. He dominates, she is submissive. She
upsets him by breaking his rules, she is punished.</span>

        <span style='font-family: inherit; color: black'>It
seems to me <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i>&nbsp;suggests a classic preparation for
domestic violence. Ask any couple who has an enduring partnership and they will
tell you it is impossible to have a successful relationship if one dominates
another. I suspect the author, E. L. James, would claim it is ultimately a
story about taming the beast – another age-old fantasy.</span>

        <span style='font-family: inherit; color: black'>The
cover story in the current Stanford University alumni magazine asks &quot;Can
sexual assault be stopped?&quot; It says 55 US colleges in 26 states are being
investigated for reported acts of sexual violence. The story cites a 2014
survey from the <span class="SpellE">the</span> University of Oregon that
reported &quot;35 per cent of females and 14 per cent of male participants had
had at least one sexual experience without their consent and that 10 per cent
of female and 0.3 per cent of male participants had been raped&quot;.&nbsp;</span>

is not the military; these colleges are elite institutions. US college campuses
are acknowledging that stopping sexual assault is a national imperative.</span>

        <span style='font-family: inherit; color: black'>What
needs to be understood by both parties in a sexual act is that a lack of
protest or resistance does not mean consent. Consent to one act does not mean
consent to another. The existence of a dating relationship does not mean
consent. An affirmative act or statement by each person that is informed,
freely and mutually given constitutes consent.</span>

        <span style='font-family: inherit; color: black'>In&nbsp;<i>Fifty
Shades</i>, Grey is well aware of the need for a signed contract, but he has no
concern that he is taking advantage of a position of influence over another,
which can be a factor in determining consent.</span>

        <span style='font-family: inherit; color: black'>While
ensuring Steele will be dependent, financially and emotionally, under his
authority and surveillance, he is grooming her for submission. This is the same
pattern as domestic violence – hurt, apologise, be nice, beg her not to leave,
then repeat the harm.&nbsp;</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: inherit; color: black'>Don't
be misled by Steele's exit at the end of the film. She comes back for more.
This movie is the warm-up. Cosmetics advertising before the film says, &quot;Prepare
for your Mr Grey&quot;. &nbsp;Just think about it; this film is a dog-whistle
for the age-old male con.</span>
