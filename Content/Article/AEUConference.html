<p><strong><u>The Role of  Television and Digital Media in the Early Years</u>. </strong><br />
    <strong>Patricia Edgar </strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Australian Education  Union Early Childhood Conference September   5th 2009</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>When I was young my favourite time of day was when the  lights went out and in bed, in the dark I could imagine. I could do anything,  be anybody, go anywhere. I loved to be read a story. I developed a passion for  comic books and radio shows. &nbsp;Nothing  pleased me more than going to the pictures. It didn&rsquo;t matter what film was on I  enjoyed them all. When I was studying I escaped to films as often as possible.  Our first television set was acquired after we were married and by then, as a  secondary school teacher, I used to keep quiet in the staff room when teachers  talked about the evils of television and how much they didn&rsquo;t watch. I was  certainly watching.</p>
<p>I have worked with children all my life in teaching,  research, policy and production roles - all related to media - yet my 4  extremely interesting grand children can still teach me a thing or two. The  speed of technological change is not a concept that means anything to them.  Technology is nothing special. </p>
<p>My work has me convinced that media have a profound  influence on the brain power, the attitudes and creativity of children and  ignoring that influence will ultimately lead to schooling becoming obsolete,  for media in its many forms are transforming children&rsquo;s lives. </p>
<p>With me today is my grand son Adrian who is 14. </p>
<p>When I was in the UK- for the last two months - the US investment  Bank Morgan Stanley released a Research report, prepared by a 15 year old  intern, who had surveyed his friends and written about their media consumption.  The lad, Mathew Robson, became the talk of Wall St and Tokyo as clients such as <em>Google</em> and <em>Facebook</em>, reportedly  clamoured for a copy of what they considered the teenagers&rsquo; ground-breaking  insights. Who would have thought that the best way to find out what teenagers&rsquo; were  doing with media was to ask them? &nbsp;</p>
<p>The insights the report exposed included:<br />
  - No teenager regularly reads a newspaper<br />
  - They listen to the radio online<br />
  - they all own mobiles but use them for texting and  listening to music not to make calls: they are very reluctant to pay for music-  most never having bought a CD<br />
  - they talk to one another via their games consoles <br />
  - they do not Twitter considering it a waste of money,<br />
  - &nbsp;<em>Facebook</em> is the most common social  networking site used.</p>
<p>In other words they adapt media and take advantage of every <u>free</u> feature on every gadget, and <u>pool </u>applications so they are as connected as  any media savvy adult, but they don&rsquo;t pay for the privilege.</p>
<p>They mould the technology to fit the rhythm and needs of  their own lives which differ from the average grown-up&rsquo;s day to day experience.  (1)</p>
<p>Adrian,  will talk with me a little later about his and his friend&rsquo;s media usage. </p>
<p>A few months ago I spoke at a workshop attended by some early  childhood teachers and I encountered strong hostility to the media. I was told  that the first action two of them had taken at the beginning of the year was to  put the computer in the cupboard. Their view was that while children were in  their care they could play outside or with others; they got enough media at  home. </p>
<p>Children must play outside, no question, but early childhood  education is about <strong>all</strong> their learning  and development - at home, playing with friends or alone and in pre-school. What  happens in every context influences their learning, and children&rsquo;s interaction  with media is far too important to exclude it from their school experience.</p>
<p>
    <img alt="Slide 1" src="images/AEUSlide1.jpg"/>
</p>
<p>There are 4 main reasons why I believe media technologies should  be included in education programs for the early years?&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>1. Media are an unavoidable part of children&rsquo;s family and  social context</strong></p>
<p>By the end of primary school Australian children are  accessing media more than 7 hours a day, more time than they spend in school or  with their parents.</p>
<p>They are immersed  in media.</p>
<p><strong>2. A second reason to  include media in early childhood development and learning is to develop media  literacy as a critical skill.</strong></p>
<p>
    <img alt="Slide 2" src="images/AEUSlide2.jpg"/>
</p>
<p> The earlier children become familiar with technology the better  understanding and control they will have. Three year-olds can learn to manipulate a mouse and should be  encouraged to do so. </p>
<p>By the time they enter school children are consumers,  attuned to the market. The characters they recognize from their television  programs when they go shopping with Mum are linked to games, books, music and all  sorts of paraphernalia, including food. They see these products and they want  them. </p>
<p>Media literacy should not simply be about having technical  skills, being protected from invasive advertisers or making an amateur video  for YouTube: it should be about <strong><em>accessing,</em></strong> <strong><em>understanding,  using and creating media.</em></strong> </p>
<p><strong>3. The third reason to  include media in the early childhood curriculum is to avoid what is called</strong> t<strong>he Digital Divide:</strong></p>
<p>The digital  divide is especially wide for kids from poor home backgrounds and from homes  where parents don&rsquo;t see or value the use of the computer, the internet or computer  games for kids&rsquo; learning. If children  are not exposed to and taught how to use technology, they will be  disadvantaged.</p>
<p>Those who enter school with no formal pre-school education  are already a year behind their peers at age 5. Lack of exposure to new  technology widens the gap.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>4. And the 4th reason is that </strong><strong>technology has enormous potential to help  children learn. </strong></p>
<p>We all know now that most of an individual&rsquo;s brain power is  generated in the first years of life, especially between birth and age 3, but  certainly up to the age of 8. </p>
<p>It was Howard Gardner who first pointed out the danger in  the narrow definition of intelligence, as measured by IQ tests we have relied  on for so long. Every child needs to be given a chance to develop a range of  skills, not just language and mathematics. </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Let&rsquo;s look at the potential of television and games for the  development of Howard Gardner&rsquo;s multiple intelligences particularly </strong>interpersonal and intra personal intelligence or emotional  intelligence. </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <img alt="Slide 3" src="images/AEUSlide3.jpg"/>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stories are the glue  that binds us together as a community. That is why local programming is important for children.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Like good books, good  television programs can help children develop emotionally, through trying out  roles not yet possible in the real world</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The 0-5 age group are forming their sense  of identity within their family, in a sex role, outside the family and within  an ethnic or racial group. Television programming can feed into this emerging  social self with a wide range of role models. <em>Lift Off </em>which I devised in 1990 had its origins in this  philosophy. And I hope such a concept will get a new lease of life within the  new national early childhood curriculum. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Toddlers  are on a journey to understanding the consequences of their actions. Through  stories they can learn you can&rsquo;t always win and life is not just a competition. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Young  children love to laugh. Humour is a great way to engage children. <em>Round the Twist</em> which I first produced  in 1989 was developed with this intention. Many children began to read on their  own through the Round the Twist series. </li>
</ul>
<p>Many of life&rsquo;s  lessons can be conveyed through stories in books, on film, video, DVDs and  television. They need to be selected with care which takes time and effort. &nbsp;Then if we build on the learning within a  program the learning becomes more effective.</p>
<p>We reject  television in the classroom because so much of it is just plain awful. It is crass, commercial and banal. But the fault lies in  the use to which the medium is put. It is so seductive for children, we have a  responsibility to use it better than we do.</p>
<p><strong>Then there are computer and video games.</strong></p>
<p>
    <img alt="Slide 4" src="images/AEUSlide4.jpg"/>
</p>
<p>The media hype  suggests games are simply bad for kids. The evidence shows otherwise. Games are  effective and valuable tools for learning from a very early age and across all  ages. (1) </p>
<p>Those who don&rsquo;t  play games &ndash; that includes most teachers and policy-makers -&nbsp; are unaware there is a science to game  playing. </p>
<p>No one tells the  kids the rules; they figure them out by playing. They seek information and piece together data from many places.  They make decisions quickly which have clear consequences. They become experts  at multi-tasking and parallel processing and learn to collaborate with others  over a range of networks. Kids can acquire these skills at a very early age. Four  and 5 year olds play <em>The Sims</em> (the  most popular computer game ever made, which is essentially a &lsquo;living  dollhouse&rsquo;) and <em>Roller Coaster Tycoon</em> where the goal is to create a successful theme park.</p>
<p>
    <img alt="Slide 5" src="images/AEUSlide5.jpg"/>
</p>
<p>Games help  cognitive development in progressively complex ways. But so far there has been  little attempt to integrate game-playing into the early childhood curriculum.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Children will watch good programs and play quality games repeatedly,  learning more each time, precisely because they can engage with the content in  increasingly sophisticated ways. It&rsquo;s hard to find school room tasks that  inspire the same motivation. </p>
<p>The young brain&rsquo;s plasticity, its capacity to learn through  repetition, reinforcement and forging new connections make good media experiences potent learning tools.</p>
<p>Technology makes it possible to design programs that are not  only appropriate to a particular age group, but also to different developmental  levels within that age group. </p>
<p>To summarise: </p>
<ul>
  <li>We should not ignore the power and potential for good  rather than harm from modern technology. No early childhood curriculum  framework can ignore what goes on in the home in the pre-school years. It is  the child&rsquo;s major learning environment and it is one saturated with media  whether we like it or not.</li>
  <li>Many teachers are unaware, unskilled or afraid of  technology and today&rsquo;s children are moving way ahead of them in media literacy  and computer skills. </li>
</ul>
<p>I believe we must therefore: </p>
<p>Become advocates &ndash;</p>
<ul>
  <li>for the production of quality children&rsquo;s media </li>
  <li>to fund the development of new media content geared to  the National Curriculum</li>
  <li>to utilise media within the early years curriculum and  guide that use effectively</li>
  <li>to train and re-train as teachers and early childhood  professionals to be&nbsp; media literate and up  with the skills of the children we teach. </li>
</ul>
