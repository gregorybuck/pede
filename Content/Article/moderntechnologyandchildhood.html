<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Modern technology and childhood learning
- a background Discussion Paper for the Victorian Children's Council</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;Don Edgar August, 2012</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The starting point for any discussion about
how children develop and learn has to be the family. Parents, siblings and
conditions in the family home are the basis of all learning - language,
self-awareness, relating to others, physical, cognitive and social skills. How
that family responds to a child sets the parameters for all learning and
development. We usually recognize this in relation to early childhood, but it
is no less true for children at later ages; the family continues to exert a
powerful influence on learning, values and social relationships even as they
move beyond the home into child care, school and wider community settings. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But today's world involves much more than
physical contacts beyond the home; it brings global influences into the home
and takes the child beyond the family's limited social networks to a virtual
(and no less real or powerful) world. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>So if we define the task of childhood as '<i>learning
to find your way around in the world'</i>, then the mass media and the tools of
modern technology take on new significance; they take every child well beyond
the intimate confines of the family home to a wealth of life experiences that
potentially help them 'find their way around' and discover who they are in
relation to the wider human family, their social and physical environment. Just
as good literature does, the new media provide a range of visual, verbal,
emotional, social and even physical modes of dealing with the world. They also
offer a pervasive set of commercial values and ethical codes of conduct which
may not be what is needed for good citizenship in the digital age.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Parents and social commentators are
justified in expressing concern about the possibly negative and damaging
consequences of exposure to new forms of technology, but we need to remember
that reading was a new technology seen as dangerous by the political elite,
comics and radio were regarded as a potential cause of moral breakdown, TV has
for over half a century been attacked as the cause of violence without any good
research justification and the latest 'moral panic' over social media
(Facebook, Twitter, etc) is in the same ballpark. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The research on new media is inconclusive,
badly designed, with small samples and often based on behavior in a laboratory,
not an ordinary life setting, subject to 'publication bias' (positive or
neutral findings are less likely to get published), with findings exaggerated
and over-hyped by the mass media. Linking a mass shooting with a new Batman
film or with having played violent computer games makes for a good story but
illuminates nothing about how new technologies are changing the lives of
today's children. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>We should be asking better questions -
about exactly what children are doing with the new media, what they are
learning from it (both positive and negative), how it is affecting their
physical and social development and what else they are doing besides, or
alongside, using such new tools. It is not a zero-sum game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The worst example of distorted thinking is
Britain's Baroness Greenfield, a neuro-scientist who has made repeated claims
for the past five years that 'the human brain is under threat from the modern
world', technology apparently 'causing' a decline in empathy and social skills,
'an increase in people with autistic spectrum disorders', with computer games
causing 'dementia in children' and broadly 'reducing the quality of life'. She
has done no research in this field, is not an expert on media effects, cites no
sound research by others to support her assertions and refuses to properly
define what she sees as the problem. Academics in the UK have called on her to
put up or shut up, yet she persists with her alarmist critique. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>'Her hypothesis seems to be that an unknown
level of use of some subset of technology could harm our brains, and may
already be damaging large swathes of society that may or may not be limited to
children, although possibly only with obsessive use.' As <i>The Guardian</i>'s
Martin Robbins (25 Feb 2012) puts it, it is 'trivial and banal to say using
social media (Twitter) obsessively 'might reduce your quality of life' ... doing
anything obsessively might.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span lang=EN-US>What does the research show?</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>First, we may well be surprised at findings
on simple media use, regardless of 'effects':</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>An ACMA survey of media use (2008) found that
children 0-4 spent 154 minutes per day viewing free-to-air television (127
minutes on commercial channels) and 194 minutes per day watching subscription
TV. That makes a total viewing time average of 5 hours 48 minutes per day for
our youngest children. Comparable figures for 5-12 year-olds were 130 minutes
for free-to-air and 160 minutes for subscription TV, a total of 4 hours 50
minutes per day.</span></p>

physical and social experiences for healthy development at this age. </span></p>

their children talking, playing games or coloring in, and those with brothers and

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><b><span lang=EN-US>Effects?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>There are many
studies claiming negative effects on children from media use, especially of
violent video games, mainly from the early 2000s (see Gentile, 2003) A meta-study
of 130 research reports (Anderson, 2010) found (across all classes and
cultures) 'exposure to video game violence does increase aggressive thoughts
and behaviors and decreased empathy and pro-social behavior', but these were
'not huge effects' and were 'just one risk factor' and 'easier to deal with than
poverty or genetic traits as causes of violent behavior'. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>Many of those
studies were small-scale laboratory observations and offered no data on real
life behavioral effects. For example an Indiana University study on 'brain
changes', claiming 'an increase in emotional arousal and a corresponding
decrease of activity in brain areas involved in self-control, inhibition and
attention', had only 44 teenagers playing two games, and one brain scan. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>More recent assessments
have been more cautious. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>A TechAddiction
report (2010) by Brent Conrad says, 'Despite three decades of research on the
effects of violent video and computer games on children, there seems to be as
much confusion as ever. Do video games lead to increased aggression and
violence? Do video games cause violence, or do those already with a propensity
for violence choose to play games with aggressive themes?' It is probably a
pointless question anyway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>Most such
studies are lacking in scientific validity and Ferguson et al (2010) write that
'trait aggression, family violence and male gender were predictive of violent
crime, but exposure to violent games was not... in fact, playing violent video
games is associated with higher visuo-spatial cognition.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>Even the claims
of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry (No. 91, March
2011, 'Children and video games: Playing with violence') are based on 'exposure
to violence' in real life, extrapolating to the effect of video games,
admitting that 'children with emotional, behavioral and learning problems may
be more influenced by violence.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>Respected UK
researcher David Buckingham comments: 'The debate we are seeing is very similar
to the one that has raged for years about television. The truth is there are
many factors that can lead to violence, such as being withdrawn and isolated,
so it's hard to say it is because of one thing.' </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>More careful
research has focused on the actual learning outcomes of playing games.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As the Federation of American Scientists
put it (2006) 'games offer attributes important for learning - clear goals,
lessons that can be practiced repeatedly until mastered, monitoring learner
progress and adjusting instruction to learner level of mastery, closing the gap
between what is learned and its use, motivation that encourages time on task,
personalization of learning, and infinite patience.' </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The American Montessori Association
insisted, some years ago, that since media technology was now so pervasive in
the lives of children its teachers should incorporate activities in the
kindergarten curriculum which treat media in the same way as other forms of everyday
experience within the Montessori framework. They now embrace iPads, digital
cameras, the internet as a means of engaging the child's active exploration of
the environment and are critical of overly-didactic DVDs such as 'Baby
Einstein' and the more passive apps often marketed to parents of young
children. (See <i>Children's Technology Review</i>, 6 June, 2010). In
Australia, one Deakin University pilot study (<i>Age</i> 31 July, 2012) found
that pre-schoolers aged 3-6 who use interactive video games, such as Wii, have
better motor skills (kicking, catching, throwing a ball). They spend an average
of three hours a week playing non-interactive games and two hours a week
playing interactive games. And a Swinburne University study is planned (Dr
Geordy Kaufman, ABC Radio National, Life Matters, 1 August, 2012) to test
whether children react to and learn in the same ways when playing with computer
apps and touch screen games as when playing with ordinary toys. They plan to
measure levels of attention and social interaction, relative developmental
benefits and levels of control, pointing out that children can today build
blocks, paint pictures or play sports using technological apps, and that 'being
obsessed' can just as easily be applied to playing with blocks as to playing on
an iPad.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Social media effects</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>So far, there is little good research on
how social media such as Facebook, MSN or Twitter affect children's behavior,
but the same extremes are reported. Some claim 'virtual' contacts are taking
over from 'real' friendships, that young people who use Facebook are more
'lonely', more likely to be self-critical and depressed than others. This, when
we know 96% of college-age students use Facebook and (2009) 12-14 year-olds are
the highest child users at 48%. So who are the 'others'? and where is the
research? US researcher Larry Rosen (2011) summed up the research so far by
saying some studies demonstrate 'narcissistic tendencies, health effects
(anxiety) and distraction from learning', but positive effects for
Facebook/social media users include 'better virtual empathy, helping
introverted adolescents learn how to socialize and providing tools for teaching
and engaging students'. A Texas study (2008) found a positive impact on life
satisfaction, social trust, civic participation and political engagement' and a
Taiwan study (2011) found social networking had a positive impact on classroom
learning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The point to be made strongly is not simply
that research 'effects' are unclear, but that these new media do occupy a lot
of children's time and have changed the nature of social interaction,
networking and the learning process. Just as reading changed the way most
people were able to think and deal with the world, expanding their
understanding and respect for diverse cultures and lifestyles (Pinker, 2011), so
too it is likely the new media are changing the way children learn about and
relate to their world. This may well involve 'brain' changes, given the brain's
plasticity, but there seems little point in suggesting that any 'brain change'
is bad for society.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In addition, what we know is that most
children are not 'obsessed' by such media, though they are excited, intrigued
and engaged by them. That is surely a positive for any child, especially those
likely to be disengaged from normal schooling and without access in the home to
ideas, discussion of social issues and specialized information.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The crucial issue for parents and educators
is, perhaps, the <u>quality</u> of media content, quite apart from the amount
of time children spend on media activities. Clearly, time spent on computer
games just shooting and killing monsters may be fun but is hardly educational
or edifying in a moral sense. But programs such as The Sims (a living
dollhouse), Club Penguin (varied game-playing social activities), Roller
Coaster Tycoon (creating a successful theme park), or Age of Mythology
(historical content) are challenging and informative. Children love building
virtual worlds and virtual playgrounds where they can create their own avatars
and interact with others in new digital environments. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The same has always applied to children's
television programs - they can be mindless time-fillers or engaging stories
with characters who explore issues and situations in ways that expand a child's
social and intellectual understanding. Parents and teachers can build on such
media content as a 'scaffold' for learning, yet too often the message is that
'entertainment' is separate from 'education' and children should not be
exposed. A related issue is, of course, the insidious association of many
children's programs with commercial advertising, the marketing of products
damaging to children's health and values that put self-indulgence ahead of
social development and self-control.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Policy-making in this area is well behind
the times. Education policy is rarely linked with communication policy (though
the National Broadband project and the federal Government's 'education
revolution' is a start in the right direction). And too often teachers lack the
skills and interest in new technologies of their 'digital native' students.
Futurelab's Lord Putnam claims students are forced to 'power down' when they
enter the classroom to cope with teachers suspicious of technology and
begrudging of its place in the schools. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>We are of course in a time of transition
with new media technology and cannot predict what the future holds. But it is
already clear that children rapidly adapt, they are avid users at an early age
of computer games, then move on to more social and interactive technologies as
they mature. They multi-task in a way many adults do not understand, watching
movies, talking on their mobile phone, playing a group interactive game,
stopping and starting again to have dinner with the family or do their chores
and picking it all up again with their friends. They are not talking with
'strangers' on Facebook, but using it as a tool to keep up with real friends
and make arrangements for getting together, or sharing homework information,
and are aware they can pretend to be someone else and keep parents out of the
loop if they wish to. Above all, their 'virtual' friends are not a replacement
for 'real' friends; they use the technology to maintain and deepen their
everyday personal inter-relationships. The mobile phone is rapidly taking over
from other desk-top computer screens and can be used for social contact,
internet information, gaming and life organizing in ways not possible a decade
ago. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Broader Political and social impacts of
new media</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Beyond the concerns of parents and
educators about the 'effects' of media use on children lie much broader issues,
such as privacy, monopoly control of information and political manipulation of
ideas and debate. Our children face a world where such issues will loom large.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Facebook was started as a social
contact/dating mechanism for elite university students. They could exchange
information about who was good-looking and 'available', their courses of study,
opinions about teachers, friends, their life interests and daily activities.
Its expansion to other colleges was rapid, but its central requirement that
no-one could access your personal details unless you had agreed to be a
'friend' remained; you had to give your own email address. It was rolled out
carefully to other campuses, then to non-student adults, next to the
professional workforce and, more recently to younger adults and children and is
now a worldwide phenomenon (with 900 million subscribers). Inevitably it became
a platform for self-presentation that could be manipulated and deceptive - you
could lie about your age, looks, interests, skills, qualifications, other
friends - and, as such, Facebook has encountered problems with cyber-stalking,
cyber-bullying and misinformation. Young people often post information about
themselves (including photos) that can be misused by predators and used against
them in later employment situations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It has enormous potential power in
spreading critical comment about political leaders, a new movie, a restaurant
or sporting event. 'Crowd-sourcing' can take the form of a spontaneous fun
dance routine in a shopping centre or the mobilization of political protests as
in the 'Arab Spring' uprisings. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Commercial businesses and public figures
cannot ignore its value. As a source of information about millions of
individuals and their personal tastes, purchases, interests and location,
Facebook has become a major marketing tool, increasingly able to 'target'
potential customers. It has become less of a 'friendship' network - indeed,
what does it mean to have thousands of 'friends' on Facebook? - and more of a
marketing tool. Critics argue that Facebook has less commercial potential than
Google because its information about individual preferences and purchases is
less direct (people go to Google to check out consumer products and sources)
and the threat to privacy as Facebook consolidates personal information into
'profiles' is worrying. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Writer David Kirkpatrick suggests
Facebook's definition of 'friend' is expanding. Whereas our traditional notion
of a friend requires a bi-directional, reciprocal interaction, Facebook now
involves three separate components of becoming a friend - 'declaring that you
know them, giving them permission to see your own information, and subscribing
to sell all the information they produce.' (Kirkpatrick, 2010, p. 312) So
Facebook's algorithms on usage lead to more detailed profiles, a picture of a
person's identity unprecedented beyond the close friendships of everyday life.
It is already 'a giant experiment in personal disclosure' (p. 314) and Facebook
is facing legal and ethical challenges in trying to guarantee user privacy
while using its vast data pool for commercial purposes. Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook's
creator and majority shareholder) claims his vision is 'to empower the
individual', to give them the tools to communicate and thrive in a global world
and prevent them being overwhelmed by large government and commercial
institutions. Yet he has, in fact, given such institutions the power to swamp
and control the individual through selective use of information, personal
profiling and identifying group interests and activities. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Some claim Facebook and other social media
are changing not just our notion of friendship and identity, but also of
'community'. Certainly it can lead to a more global sense of community, as in
mobilizing opposition to tyranny, developing a common interest in the
environment and by breaking down ethnic, religious and social barriers. But it
could just as easily lead to a reinforcement of 'tribal separation' if it comes
to be used simply as a way of connecting more closely with those we already
know. That was its original intention but it expanded to an unbridled sharing
with 'friends' only remotely connected. Now it seems to be reverting to its
original, instrumental purpose - to contact, share information with and
reinforce friendships children (and adults) already have. After all, you don't
have to 'friend' someone to obtain specialized information when the internet
via Google offers that free of charge and free of any mutual obligations. The
worry is that any use of the internet in this global market-driven age provides
more information about the 'self' and our personal networks than we may safely
be comfortable with. The mutual disclosure of self that lies at the core of modern
intimacy (Giddens, 1995) may be even more volatile and dangerous when it is
readily accessible to unseen masters of the universe. Shared intimacy is based
on trust; an open system may not be trustworthy. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Even if Facebook restricted access to its
data on individual users and, as its founder Mark Zuckerberg insists, ensured
'humans maintain mastery over technology' ... by ... 'helping the world's people
self-organise' (Kirkpatrick, p. 325), Facebook has access itself to that data
and is in itself 'a giant surveillance system'. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>So too are Google and its rivals Bing and
Yahoo, plus the new kid on the block Twitter. They all rely for profits on
profiling users and their commercial potential. Both Google and Bing are trying
to incorporate Facebook data on friends' activities into their profiling of
user searches. Google also maps neighborhoods around the world via satellite and
street cameras and can target ads about related products (including porn) to
people searching the web from their local homes. The up side of this is the
convenience of having GPS road map systems in cars, but the 'Big Brother'
overtones are worrying to many people. Google is also digitizing the world's
books, giving unprecedented access for the wider public to literature and
specialized research papers. The internet has become the first port of call for
global information searches and children and young people need to be guided
towards more sophisticated skills in judging the worth and validity of varied
sources (e.g. the dilemma of relying on Wikipedia versus unequal access to what
used to be print-only specialized information).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The dilemmas of privacy versus surveillance
and free access versus political control became evident in Google's attempted
expansion into the giant potential market of China. Since 2000 Google has
operated a free-access service from outside China but within the country
government blocking of certain information (such as about the Tienanmen Square
uprising and massacre, porn and political websites) via what was called 'the
Great Firewall of China'). Microsoft and Yahoo operated censored Web sites in
China, so Google's founders Brin &amp; Page did 'an evil scale' (their company
motto was 'Do no evil') and decided to build a China-based website, subject to
censorship, on the basis it was better to serve Chinese users somehow rather
than not at all. They invest philanthropically in genomics, alternative energy
research and alternate means of giving users access where there is no
electricity grid, but the commercial imperative inevitably drives many
decisions that will affect how we live, learn and think.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In this light, it is my view that
educators, parents and community leaders should be thinking harder about the
global social and political effects of the new media and taking less notice of
the exaggerated fears about 'media effects' on children. The most powerful
effect is clearly that of giving more children access to information, ideas,
opinions than they have ever had before; they are exposed to the world in ways
we could not have imagined a quarter of a century ago. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>We are starting to see a revolution in
higher education, where tertiary students can complete online courses from
universities around the world such as Stanford, Harvard and MIT. iTunesU is run
by Apple, edX by the University of California, Udacity by Stanford's computer
science faculty and newcomer Coursera is partnering with them and already has a
million enrolments, including 7000 from Australia. (See Amanda Dunn &amp; Katie
Cincotta, 'Free courses from world's top unis a swipe away in online
revolution', <i>The Sunday </i>Age, 12 August, 2012).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Many of our schools have embraced computer
technology while others resist it, potentially exacerbating the 'digital
divide' which already disadvantages many students from homes where such
resources are lacking. The message for schooling is not that online courses
will or should replace classroom teaching; rather that classroom teaching
itself must adapt. The basics of literacy, numeracy and learning to interpret
information will remain, for every student using online resources must be able
to read and think clearly, but the teacher must become even more an
inspirational, motivational leader in learning, able to guide students in more
self-directed learning than we have ever seen before. Teachers have to be ahead
of the digital game, not resistant to it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>What follows should be a stronger demand
that the new media offer reliable information, clearly differentiate opinion
from factual information, ensure a safe 'virtual environment' for children and
safeguards against predators, protect better the privacy of all citizens and
deny (insofar as it is possible) the use of personal information for purely
commercial or political purposes. But above all we should be demanding that
governments fund and commercial operators provide better quality content, so
that children truly benefit in learning and development terms while being
'entertained'. That will only happen if education policies are linked with
communication policies and if teacher training programs recognize and embrace
the enormous learning potential of the new media, guiding students (not just
through media literacy but through active use of the media in the classroom)
towards more responsible and discriminating use of the time they spend.</span></p>
