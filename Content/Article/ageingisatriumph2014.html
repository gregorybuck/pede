is a triumph and a new research paradigm is needed</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'>We have a problem
with social attitudes towards ageing and it's not just with politicians and
policy bureaucrats. It's with the media, journalists and misguided advertising
where older people are rarely presented in any way but negative. And it's with
the wider public who are obsessed with trying to stay and look young, and who
view with dread the negative stereotyping applied to what will be the largest
cohort of people over 60 ever seen in the history of mankind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'>It is claimed a
pending tsunami of the aged will create a social and economic crisis. The
validity of such claims is questionable so we need evidenced based studies to
understand this demographic revolution. The aged are no longer the halt, the
sick and the lame. They are a new breed and we need to move beyond last century
models of gerontology. We need new research because we can't develop sensible
policies and programs for people when we don't know who we are talking about.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'>Treasury and age
researchers need to be reminded that people do not just become dependent when
we become old. How useful is the measure of GDP in understanding this assertion
when caring, voluntary and creative work which contributes $200 billion to the
economy is not counted in GDP? And to what extent is ageing really the cause of
escalation in health care costs? Much of the increase is due to new
technologies, new pharmaceuticals and treatments, not ageing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'>We need to think of
ageing not as a disease, but as a process of living. It's not even a 'stage',
as we begin to age from the moment of birth - with no clear cut-off point
defining when we become 'old'. It is the ageing process and its variations that
should be the focus of research and the development of ageing policy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'>Clearly our bodies do
not stand alone - they operate within diverse and changing physical and social
conditions that explain as much, if not more, about how we age differentially
than genetic makeup and inherent weaknesses. The really interesting questions
will be what differences in lifestyle explain why and how genes operate and
mutate differentially as we gradually age? How do we help people understand
that they can modify their lifestyle to alleviate the effects of physical
ageing, rather than waiting for a new miracle drug or passively accept the
inevitability of decline?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'>Research by the
American National Institute of Ageing suggests negative stereotypes influence
how elders view themselves: they even adversely affect health and longevity
becoming self fulfilling prophesies. The&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;reports
studies that show seeing or hearing gloomy nostrums about what it is like to be
old can make people walk more slowly, hear and remember less well, and even
affect their cardio-vascular system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'>We need to shift the
research paradigm from a medical, disease-prevention model, which starts from a
'problem' to be solved, with 'cures' or 'treatments' to be found and prescribed
to a model based on well being - using concepts like 'healthy ageing', 'optimal
ageing', 'positive outcomes from health intervention'. The terms we use will
make all the difference. But people (including professionals) are slow to grasp
this concept and seem to persist with their old habits.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'>The new ageing
research paradigm should identify the factors that distinguish those who age
healthily and optimally from those who do not, applying in control group
experiments interventions which are likely to have a positive effect on the
ageing experience; and measure the outcomes in individual, social and economic
terms. We should study the very old who are&nbsp;<u>not</u>&nbsp;having medical
or 'ageing' problems and we should ask why. Research has to measure outcomes
and measure 'success', not by how many drugs are administered, but by whether,
and by how much, health and wellbeing are actually advanced.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'>Ageing research funds
would be more likely to flow if we could demonstrate to Treasury more positive
outcomes for society and the economy as well as the individual.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'>Such a paradigm shift
requires researchers to be active disseminators of their work, to get the
evidence-based message out into the community. Publishing a paper, or
presenting at a conference is not enough. Universities are notoriously slow to
turn their research and peer-reviewed articles into papers and positions that
can influence public policy. But that is an essential part of the job. That
engagement is what research in this field now requires.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'>Other research
questions need to examine how education and social engagement can enliven the
brain, prolong a healthy life and stall dementia; how lack of social contacts
and support can be a person's undoing. Changed patterns of marriage,
separation, divorce and remarriage obviously alter the experience of ageing,
yet where is the research on support for the aged when divorce has disrupted
contact between grandparents and grandchildren? Or where a new partner does not
get on with their in-laws? Or where perhaps the existence of multiple parents
and grandparents transforms the nuclear couple family into an extended 'lattice
family' with multiple support networks?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'>Who will do the
research on how the trend for young people to live at home into their thirties,
delay marriage, bring sexual partners into the parental home, plus the rising
cost of housing and extended 'earn or learn' policies for unemployed youth,
combine to alter the patterns of inter-generational relationships and, in
particular, the way family support systems cope with an ageing population? Such
changed patterns will generate new challenges for future public policy
decisions. But we need new research to convince the policy makers that a whole
new approach to ageing is worthwhile and necessary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'>Unless researchers
start to document such issues, we will continue to stereotype the aged as a
dependent burden on society which is far from the case.</span></p>
