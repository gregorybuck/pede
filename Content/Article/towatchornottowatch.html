<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Most parents have heard the claim that
television viewing is bad for young children. Young mothers agonise over
whether they should allow their young to watch television and they feel guilty
when they inevitably do. Their concerns are understandable given such
authorities as the UK Baroness Susan Greenfield, whose speciality is the
physiology of the brain, claims modern technology is damaging children's
brains. As well the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends children under
the age of two should not watch television and recently claimed that having TV
on in the house at all is bad for kids.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>There is little evidence to support
these widely reported claims.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Most research on television's effects
has focused on school aged children. Researchers did not study media's effects
on toddlers and children under three until, in 1996, a stay-at-home mother,
Julie Aigner-Clark, produced a VHS video called Baby Einstein which showed a
variety of toys and visuals interspersed with music, stories, numbers and words
in many languages. The video was marketed across the United States, Europe,
Asia and Australia and became a multi-million dollar franchise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Mothers wanted their babies to be a Baby
Einstein and in no time one in three households with babies, in the markets
targeted, owned at least one Baby Einstein product. The Walt Disney Company
bought Baby Einstein and the television industry pumped out television shows
for babies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Researchers then turned their attention
to what children were learning from such programs, finding they learnt very
little. Researchers then asked was viewing television at such a young age actually
damaging to children? Pediatricians became interested and, as early as 1999,
the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended against television viewing for
children under the age of two. They argued 'research on early brain development
shows that babies and toddlers have a critical need for direct interactions
with parents and other significant caregivers for healthy brain growth and the
development of appropriate social, emotional and cognitive skills'. Therefore
they concluded, 'exposing such young children to television programmes should
be discouraged'. The conclusion did not follow from the evidence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>In 2004 a pediatrician from Seattle, Dr
Dimitri A. Christakis with a group of colleagues published an article in the
Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics concluding that early television
exposure was associated with attention problems at age 7 (including
contributing to ADHD). They suggested efforts to limit television viewing in
early childhood <b>may </b>be warranted but additional research was needed. The
finding went viral without the qualifying statements and without the attacks on
the methodology employed in the study which had followed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Baroness Greenfield and countless
advocates have distorted an argument which has no solid basis in research. Dr
Ben Goldacre a British science writer, doctor and psychiatrist challenged
Greenfield in the London Guardian (October 21, 2011) saying, given she had not
undertaken any research or properly evaluated the available evidence she
'should set out her concerns in a scientific paper'. He's waiting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>So what <b>do</b> we know about young
children and the effects of viewing television in any format? Shelley Pasnik, a
media expert in the US, has scoured the research to answer the most commonly
asked questions about young children and television. She found about 40% of
children watch TV, DVDs or video every day and 75% of children have watched
television before they are 2 years old. Most parents report they are in the
room with their children while they watch. Children under 6 watch television
about 2 hours a day yet there is surprisingly little research done on the
effects on these infants and toddlers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>TV viewing does not really take the
place of other activities such as playing outside. Children who watch more TV
than others may do so because they are unable to go outside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>It does matter what very young children
watch. Programs that are well designed and take into consideration children's
developmental stages are more likely to have educational merit than those
geared towards commercial ends. But the child who will benefit most is the
child whose parent finds ways to interact during viewing and to take advantage
of learning opportunities embedded in a program.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Children probably understand much more
than we realise from television programs but it's not easy to measure their
learning. When children do not understand they don't pay attention. We know
they recognise specific brands promoted by television advertising and children
as young as one will avoid an object after they watch an actor react negatively
to it on video: they apply emotional reactions seen on television to their own
behavior. There may be a connection between television viewing and obesity as
the amount of time a child spends watching television also affects obesity
rates. But diet matters too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Not surprisingly children in
heavy-viewing households (average 6 hours a day) are less likely to be able to
read than other children and watching adult programs has been associated with
reduced vocabulary. Having television playing in the background does reduce
attention spans and parent-child interactions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>None of this should be surprising: it is
common sense. Certainly parental rules can influence viewing and parents who
have a positive attitude towards television generally view with their children.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>So the answer is to use television in
moderation. Used sensibly by parents - as part of a day of balanced activities
– children and families benefit. Television is helpful for relaxation, for
babysitting, for giving time out and reducing conflict. Yes, interaction with
parents is vital to child development but parents cannot be interacting with
children all day. They need relief and opportunities to fulfill other work and
family demands.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>For years I have decried the banal,
unimaginative, commercialism and benign morality of much of the fodder that
fills children's timeslots. Interestingly Emily Nussbaum, the New Yorker's
television critic believes there is a renaissance in children's programming.
She cites shows which respect the medium's strengths and constraints without
viewing kids with disdain. Shows like the Dutch <i>Miffy and Friends</i>, the
British <i>Charlie and Lola</i>, <i>Little Bill, The Backyardigans, Yo Gabba
Gabba, Wonder Pets, Phineas and Ferb </i>which have screened on PBS, Disney and
Nickelodeon as the channels search for the new blockbuster. We need more of
such programs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Asking parents to turn off television is
unrealistic: as a policy goal it will fail. The argument should be about
insisting children are offered quality television to watch.</span></p>
