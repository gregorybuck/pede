<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;<b><u>Hazel Hawke Written Out in
Biased History - Patricia Edgar</u></b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The dramatised documentary <i>Hawke</i>
screened on Sunday (18July) depicts a downtrodden, frumpish, glum-faced Hazel
Hawke drifting about in dressing- gown and slacks, playing a peripheral role in
her husband's ascension to the role of Prime Minister of Australia. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>History is a fertile field for half truths,
innuendo and the suppression of facts. Women have been written out of history
for centuries and Hazel joins a long line of outstanding women who have not
been fairly recognised by their partners and in this case, a second wife who wants
to claim her place as the great love of a great man who did much for his
country.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Blanche D'Alpuget says she believes people
will remember the Bob and Blanche story for their great love. She seems to identify
with famous lovers like Napoleon and Josephine, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony, or
perhaps it is Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Sue Pieters-Hawke, the daughter, in her
dignified response to her step-mother's account of history (The Age July 17) takes
exception to the fundamental misrepresentations in the characterization of her
mother and her parents' marriage. 'If my mother could speak for herself...' We
know Hazel cannot do this and it's highly possible she would not participate in
this public circus if she could.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Dramatised television documentary presents
a convincing picture of the way things were. But this 'documentary', based on two
biographies of Hawke by D'Alpuget dismisses her predecessor with a few kind
words, but mainly as a politically ambitious partner in a failed marriage who
clung on for her place in the sun. This is fiction and fantasy for those who
knew Hazel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Bill Hayden said that the drover's dog
could have led the Labor Party to victory in 1983. Bob Hawke was worried about
the number of votes he would lose as a divorced man so he implored Hazel to
stay with him. It was the right call.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It did not take long for Hazel to develop a
following of her own which in subsequent elections became a major reason voters
supported Hawke. Hazel's speech to the Canberra Press Gallery in January 1974
established her as an unassuming, disarmingly honest, sincere and intelligent
human being - an ordinary woman, one we could all identify with and admire for
the way she handled herself. The feeling was strong among women that if Hazel
stayed with Bob he couldn't be as bad as reports suggested.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In interview on Sunday following the
telemovie, Bob struggled to remember what Hazel's interests were as the Prime
Minister's wife. He came up with 'education' but he could not remember any
details.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Children, their welfare and the arts were
Hazel's priorities. (Hazel was an accomplished pianist). Among other
organizations, The Brotherhood of St Laurence, Austcare, the Australian Youth
Orchestra, the NSW Heritage Council, World Wide Fund for Nature and the
Australian Children's Television Foundation (ACTF) had Hazel's support. This
meant she worked for them; she was not just a figurehead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I was two years into my appointment as
Founding Director of the ACTF when Hazel agreed to join the Board in December
1983; she remained a member for 18 years and over that time we shared a lot of
history.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It was my privilege and good fortune to
work alongside and get to know Hazel through those years. She used her public
profile selflessly and strategically to promote the causes she chose, including
children's television.  She opened our events and launched our series. She
introduced our programs whenever she travelled in an official capacity, taking
videos as gifts to the King and Queen of Jordan, to Nancy Reagan as First Lady,
to Prince Charles and Princess Diana. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Hazel set up a critically important meeting
and came with me to see Michael Duffy when he was Minister for Communications
in the Hawke government. Duffy respected Hazel. He was under siege at a time
when there was serious conflict between the commercial television stations and
the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. Fifteen commercial licensees were challenging
the validity of the Children's Program Standards in the High Court which handed
down a decision stating the Standards were invalid. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Michael Duffy introduced an Amendment Bill
strengthening the Broadcasting Television Act and affirming the Tribunal's
powers to impose quotas and Standards. Without this legislation the children's
television production industry could not have become the successful domestic
and international business it did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In the D'Alpuget biography Hazel is
credited with 'hitting it off' with Barbara Bush. Indeed she did. And in
January 1992 Barbara Bush visited the ACTF in Melbourne, giving the Early Childhood
Program <i>Lift-Off</i> an international stage. This was the only visit to an organisation Barbara Bush made while in Australia and it was said to be the reason George Bush came to Melbourne. Unfortunately Hazel, although a member of the Board, was not able to attend. She backed out so there could be no embarrassment to Anita Keating. Paul Keating&#39;s successful challenge had taken place in December and Hazel was no longer the Prime Minister&#39;s wife.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Hazel never complained about the cards
dealt her in life: not when her husband walked out after she had supported his
ambition; not when she became the victim of Alzheimer's. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She and Bob had built a new home in Sydney where they were living together. Hazel invited me and another colleague to visit. She
told us that Bob and Blanche wished to marry sooner rather than later but the
law required separation for a year prior to divorce. To move the wedding date
forward Bob wanted Hazel to agree that they had not been living as man and wife,
although they were living under the same roof and undertaking public functions
together. She feared financial retribution for the children if she did not
agree. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>We urged her to seek independent legal
advice. But Hazel chose to go quietly. She moved to a simple suburban home
while Bob and Blanche moved into the harbor mansion. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Hazel's memory had been troubling her and
she suggested she resign from the ACTF Board. I talked her out of it at first
but by 2001 she could not travel alone. At her farewell Board dinner she made a
speech that was lucid and very moving for all those present who knew what lay
ahead as she made no secret of her condition. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Hazel is an exceptional person who was always
gracious. Bob Hawke was a fortunate man to have her by his side when he ran to
be the Prime Minister of Australia. His wife was an important vote winner and
it is unlikely Bob's ambitions would have been fulfilled without her loyalty
and dedication to him and the genuine care she demonstrated for the people of Australia. She is not someone to be cursorily dismissed from our history.</span></p>
