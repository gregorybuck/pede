often the media stand accused about their negative influence on children with

Summit movement on Media for Children since its inception in Melbourne in 1995,
has fostered a positive, health-promoting model of quality media that will
enhance child development and learning, and empower children to strengthen what
they are already creating as 'producers' of media content. Children have become
very active participants who are reshaping the media environment on their own
terms, not just 'consumers' in need of adult protection.</span>

UNICEF released a study of six major dimensions of child well-being and media
was not one of them. The Report stated : 'The true measure of a nation's
standing is how well it attends to its children – their health and safety,
their material security, their education and socialisation and their sense of
being loved, valued and included in the families and societies into which they
are born'.</span>

should argue with that, but children's well-being should be firmly at the centre
of the debate around young people, media and technology. Globally there are
important rights children should be able to expect in relation to media and
their use of media.</span>

        <span

have a right to see themselves, their communities and their cultures reflected
accurately and with respect in media content, not just to be exposed to a
homogenised, globalised, consumer-driven market culture. Children have a right
to programs that are of high quality in terms of scripts, characters and
production values. They have a right to stories and activities that are
entertaining, educational and inspiring to their thinking and learning
processes.</span>

        <span

children have a right to be given a voice for their ideas and life goals, and
guided towards more sophisticated expression of their voices in all forms of
traditional and new media. Instead of sitting outside the standard media
structures, children's own productions and ideas for media programs need to be
listened to and welcomed.</span>

disadvantaged in the digital age. This is especially important for girls. Much
educational disadvantage could be addressed through better access to digital
media.</span>

they access and use.</span>

        <span
            style='font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black'>Fifth,
children have a right to have schools and education policy more closely linked
with communication policy in recognition of the fact that children learn as
much from exposure to media as they do from the standard school curriculum.</span>

        <span
            style='font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black'>Such
rights imply a shift in focus away from seeing media as the enemy, a threat,
something to be warned about and regulated negatively. This approach has
dominated the thinking behind the adult agenda for children far too long. This
means closer attention needs to be paid to the quality of programs currently
offered by producers and broadcasters. We should be discussing the values that
underpin children's media programs. How do current programs impact on
children's understanding of the world? How can we educate writers and producers
to better use the educational, social and moral potential of their media
products?</span>

        <span
            style='font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black'>We need
wider discussion and understanding of the role media play in early childhood
learning (in developing socio-emotional intelligence, literacy and cognitive
ability) and, in particular, we need a concerted campaign to insist with
governments and regulators that media policy take into account the positive
ways digital media could be incorporated in school learning.</span>

        <span
            style='font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black'>That would
mean a much more sophisticated approach to media literacy in the school
curriculum. We need teachers who understand the media production process, not
people just trained in theory to understand the semiotics of media, or the
tricks of advertising, or dangers of cyber-bullying, or to oppose to what they
regard as the damage of 'multi-tasking'. On that issue there is not one
credible study that supports this view. On the contrary, brain research is
demonstrating the resilience of the brain. The more the brain is challenged the
better it responds. There is no such thing as mono-tasking.</span>

        <span

that the brain is always multi-tasking and our goal should be to harness the
new media so they enhance every aspect of child development and learning. We
need a completely new model of digital teaching and learning and all teachers,
not just media literacy teachers, have to become part of that process.</span>

        <span
            style='font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black'>Above all,
we need to channel children's newfound and innate ability to communicate
directly via the new media into higher quality self-productions, cross-cultural
exchanges of educational material, sharing learning resources across advantaged
and disadvantaged areas of the globe and within nations, so that all the
world's children grasp their right to quality learning and full development of
their potential.</span>

have a right to the best that media can offer; they are the future citizens of
a different, digital world most of us are struggling to understand. As a tool
for the voice of children, as a tool for the education of children, as a tool
for cultural identity the media are unequalled. They are a most powerful force
affecting children's lives everywhere. Difficult as it may be it is our task to
think this through.</span>
