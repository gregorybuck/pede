unreasonable to suggest eligibility for the old age pension should be 70 years.
It is after all more than 100 years since the old age and invalid pensions were
introduced at age 65 for men and 60 for women. In that time we have become
fitter and healthier and our life expectancy has increased by 35 years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Working
longer is not the problem. The problem is the discrimination, abuse and failure
to acknowledge the contribution the ageing population has made and is making to
the society that accompanies this announcement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Increasingly
people want to work as they get older. ABS data show only 13 per cent of
workers plan to retire by 60. Those who say they will never retire have gone
from 384,000 to 575,000. Able-bodied people don't want to sit around for what
is shaping up to be possibly the longest stage of their lives without
contributing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>But
discrimination is keeping them out of the paid workforce where Joe Hockey says
they must be. There are significant barriers that older Australians face when
they look for meaningful work. HR managers have bought into the ageing
stereotypes, preferring younger employees and targeting those over 50 for
redundancy. Some of the myths that surround older workers are that they will
cost a business more for their experience; there is no long-term benefit to
their training and development; younger workers are better performers; mature
age workers won't be able to adapt to changes and new technology and they will
be prone to health problems.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>ABS and OECD
data prove these assumptions false. Mature age employees can save costs to
employers through increased rates of retention. The data show workers aged over
55 are five times less likely to change jobs compared with workers aged 20-24
thus reducing ongoing recruitment and training costs. Also their rates of
absenteeism are lower, so there is a greater investment return on their
training. Retention of mature age workers can help maintain corporate memory
and there is a strategic business advantage in having employees who reflect the
diversity of the customer base as the Australian population ages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>OECD research
shows that those countries that provide a higher level of training to older
workers have workers leaving the labour market at an older age, thus there is
long-term benefit to their training and development. Verbal skills,
communication and intelligence remain unchanged as a person ages so experience
is a better indicator of productivity than age.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
12.75pt;vertical-align:baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";
color:black'>Australians aged 55-64 are the fastest growing users of
&nbsp;information technology and appropriate training provided in a supportive
environment can greatly assist older workers to learn new technology systems
effectively. As well, the ABS data shows mature age workers are less likely to
take sick leave and experience work-related injuries than younger workers.
Payment of a bonus by government to encourage employment of older workers (</span><i><span
style='font-size:11.5pt;font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>The Age</span></i><span
style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>&nbsp;26/5/14) shows
recognition of the problem. But much more is needed to shift the deep-seated
cultural bias reflected in employers' attitudes towards the aged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Alongside the
pervasive discrimination against older people in the workforce there is a lack
of recognition of the significant work that the over 65s already do as
volunteers and the value of that work to the Australian economy. The Treasurer
should realise social capital is a major contribution to what Treasury narrowly
defines as the economy. But when Joe Hockey says people should work as long as
they can he discounts this significant contribution. Treasury should do some
sums on the social capital that volunteer work produces and how that impacts on
our economy.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Those over 55
contribute the staggering sum of $74.5 billion a year through caring for
spouses and grandchildren and in other unpaid voluntary work, which allows
others to work. &nbsp;Women aged 65 to 74 contributed $16 billion in unpaid
work inside and outside the home; men of that age, who are fewer in number,
contributed another $10.3 billion.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Dr Lisel
O'Dwyer, a senior research associate in the University of Adelaide published a
study in 2012 estimating the monetary value of the work done by the 6.4 million
people who volunteer their time in Australia. She estimates that value as more
than $200 billion a year, outstripping revenue sources from mining, agriculture
and the retail sector. The study suggested that even a 1 per cent increase in
social capital (including volunteering) was likely to lead to falls in
homicides, sexual assaults, burglaries and vehicle thefts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>More and more
retirees are finding purpose in volunteering and caring and their contribution
is highly relevant to this debate about who is deserving of a pension.
Volunteers get satisfaction from helping others, enhancing the quality of their
life and their health. They are healthier, fitter, more mentally alert and more
socially connected than other people as a result and the payback to the economy
and workplace is massive. The cost of a pension to such people is an investment
in the social order.</span></p>
