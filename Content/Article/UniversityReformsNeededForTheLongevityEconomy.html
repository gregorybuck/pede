                Tinkering at the edges of university financing
                and student loan repayments ignores the tsunami of social change that is the
                real challenge for Australia's future higher education system. Nick Xenophon is
                right to call for a full-scale inquiry into higher education; it is a mess, not

            Technology and increasing automation of the workplace will
            produce a completely different scenario and, with life expectancy increasing to
            well over 80, every individual will face the need to retrain, relearn, unlearn,
            shift jobs and reinvent themselves several times. Education as 'preparation'
            for a job should be reframed as a process of lifelong learning, constantly
            adapting, learning new skills, changing focus.

            Universities are out of touch with the new reality: offering

            There are already over 7 million people in what we call the new
            middle age, aged between 50 to 75, the best educated, most productive, skilled
            and experienced group Australia has ever seen. Most of them remain in the
            workforce, want to stay being useful and earning a living, but face the
            challenge of keeping up with technological and workplace change as we move into
            a service-based, information economy. Many are discriminated against in the
            workplace, the first to be made redundant, not offered training opportunities
            and then ignored as too old when applying for a new job.

            Governments would be wise to recognise that education and
            training policies are not just for the young; they must increasingly cater for

            population.

            The 'lump of labour fallacy' - that the old should give way for
            the young and not hold on to jobs too long - has been exposed already in
            Europe, where population ageing is ahead of ours. Australia has a middle-ageing
            population, not an ageing one, and the jobs such people do cannot be done well
            by young new entrants. The cost-benefits of retaining our mature workers,
            offering them retraining and more flexible work arrangements, outweigh the
            younger workers' lower productivity and commitment. Wall St banker and Donald
            Trump adviser David Solomon recently predicted business itself will have to
            enter the retraining scene and invest in their current workforce as AI ramps up
            and new skilled workers cannot be found&nbsp;<i>(The Australian,&nbsp;</i>23
            September, 2017). In fact, companies such as AT&amp;T are already cooperating
            with universities to offer bespoke courses upgrading the skills of their
            experienced workers. They even give these employees up to $30,000 to pay for
            them.

            Some 40% of the Australian work-force face the likelihood of
            jobs being replaced by computers in the next 10-15 years, yet they cannot
            commit to a full degree with rigid course requirements. That means tertiary
            education will have to shift towards more open enrolment practices, better
            recognition of prior work experience and learning, and a more tailor-made
            approach to degrees based on student choice and self-learning practices. The
            old days of lectures plus tutorials are gone, to be replaced by what is called
            'the flipped classroom' and hands-on, problem-solving activity.

            Universities can no longer be the domain of academic
            master-teachers. They will have to adopt the Bunnings Model - utilising the
            experience of middle-aged people as mentors, tutors, on-the-job supervisors,
            teachers in TAFE colleges, schools. Self-learning will also triumph over
            top-down teaching. The rich sources of the internet, MOOCs run by top overseas
            universities, even YouTube and exchange learning via Skype, are all just as
            effective in training for the new world of work as any static university course
            of lectures and tutorials.

            Some Australian universities are ahead of the game, and they are
            not of the G8 mould. For example, La Trobe University's model of&nbsp;<i>

            requirements and students tailoring their own degrees to suit existing skills
            and future needs; linking on-campus, online and blended courses; shorter cycle
            qualifications and credentials that respond more quickly to industry changes
            and the changing needs of the workforce; and a stronger focus on career
            management for students, including post-university 'top-ups' and new skills
            upgrading.

            Deakin University, in cooperation with Westpac, has formed&nbsp;<i>DeakinCo</i>,
            to recognise 'soft' skills (critical for a range of business functions) and
            existing workplace experience as part credits for a degree or diploma. Deakin
            allows people to start postgraduate courses at any time, breaking them up into
            two-week 'sprints' which can be scheduled to suit other life demands and
            responsibilities. The University of New England allows students not wanting a
            full degree to freely choose courses that suit their needs and assemble them
            into a 'bespoke' course, mixing and matching across different areas and levels
            of study.

            Such changes won't be easy to implement with current regulations
            and funding cuts, but they are at least trying to respond to 'The Longevity
            Economy', where lifelong learning will involve closer physical collaboration
            between university researchers and industry/business, universities acting as
            brokers of the links between young entrepreneurs and potential mentors,
            supporters and funders.

            Another challenge to our current university model comes from
            technology itself. Lecture rooms are already emptying because lectures can be

            Silicon&nbsp;Valley's MOOCs allow people to learn what they need

            classes. They cost much less and, like Netflix, learning is available on

            The middle-aged are better prepared than young people for the
