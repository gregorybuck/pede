many people, politicians included, are running scared about health costs

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:

celebrating living longer lives as one of the greatest achievements of the 20th
century. Instead ageing is seen by the US political economist Robert Reich as
''a far bigger threat to the world economy than the eurozone debt crisis, US
unemployment and the Chinese slowdown combined - a problem unfolding like a
slow-motion train wreck''.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Our
politicians are talking up this scenario. Healthcare, they claim, will be
unaffordable. The myth that health costs and aged care will be the straws that
break our system's back derives from simplistic analysis.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>The longer we
work, the more these costs will be relieved, and experts who look beyond the
bottom line to examine the system point out there are many ways it can be more
cost effective.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Healthcare
prevention programs have increased the period of life that is free from
disability and disease.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Logic and
sound social and economic planning suggest that since our lifespan will
continue to increase, it would make sense to continue to narrow the gap between
ill health, decline and death and increase quality of life for as long as
possible. Those who live longer, healthy lives can reasonably expect to have a
short period of acute illness before they die.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Our
expenditure on health services is not unreasonable for a developed country:
Canada, Switzerland, France, Germany and the US spend more than we do. As well,
studies of actual health costs show ageing is a minor part of cost increases in
the medical process in Australia and internationally, and there are many ways
by which costs could be reduced.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>As part of a
re-evaluation of ageing policies, medical guidelines for the dying must be
improved. But we are not very good at talking about death. In the absence of
such talk, millions of dollars are wasted on ''futile'' aggressive medical
interventions on patients, unable to speak for themselves, whose death is
inevitable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>It has been
calculated that advance care planning would save $250 million annually, not to
mention avoiding the trauma to patients and relatives of last-ditch efforts to
extend life. This is one burden on overstretched hospitals that could be eased.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>New knowledge
and technical change have led to a sharp increase in expenditure on technology,
therapeutic appliances and pharmaceuticals since the late 1990s.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>These
initiatives have some benefits and some downside. The use and abuse of
pharmaceuticals should be examined to determine appropriate usage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Advances in
pharmaceuticals have reduced the need for treatment in hospitals and allowed
the aged to remain in their homes, thereby reducing aged-care costs. And then
there is the new science of pharmacogenics - prescribing drugs based on an
individual's biomarkers, which can be examined through a simple blood test.
This can tell a doctor whether a patient will have a good response to a drug, a
poor response or no response at all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Applying this
science would save the health system $12 billion over the next five years from
avoided adverse drug reactions and unnecessary pharmaceutical spending, as well
as improving dramatically the lives of many patients - yet this is not
happening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>New
technologies have already helped reduce rates of hospital admission and the
duration of hospital stays. Two examples are the use of improved anaesthetics
for older patients, and improved cataract surgery techniques.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Surgical
methods need reviewing as some doctors are questioning the value of procedures
such as arthroscopy, spine fusion of the lower back and carotid artery surgery
for people with blockages in the neck. There is mounting evidence they are
ineffective and other treatments could be more useful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Doctors are
calling for new surgical techniques to be subjected to the same level of
scrutiny as new drugs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Promotion of
the aged-care burden myth may have a political purpose - to favour the private
health sector and seek to contain public sector activity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Government
has been successful in the past in identifying areas for reform in the
health-prevention sector that have been cost effective. For example, the
HIV/AIDS campaign; the anti-smoking campaign; fluoridation of water; regulation
of safety belts; drink-driving campaigns.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Now they need
to pay attention to the pharmaceutical industry and education about the proper
use of pharmaceuticals; evaluate the way doctors prescribe them; and get people
off unnecessary drugs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>To improve
efficiency, state-of-the-art IT systems need to be installed throughout the
health system. Alongside reforms within the system there should be a national
program to advance health and wellbeing through consumer education, including
exercise campaigns. Almost one-third of Australians over 65 do not exercise at
all. Accessible exercise programs should be a priority as the potential to
reduce cost to the overall system from such programs is massive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Dementia is
seen as another future ''burden'' on society and while the major effort is
going into a pharmaceutical solution, interesting research reveals there may be
a simpler way. There is a 45 per cent decrease in dementia among older people
who are regularly using a computer compared with those who are not. So why
aren't there more courses on IT for ''oldies''?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Old age is a
natural and inevitable stage of life, which has its particular needs as does
childhood, adolescence, our adult years and our working life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Those needs
form part of our social contract with government, a key aspect of living in a
democracy. The needs of old age should be seen as no more of a burden than
childcare services, education services, gainful employment, health, disability
and welfare services. At each stage of life the state provides essential
services and does not scapegoat the recipient of those services. The provisions
for old age should be in the same category.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>The facts
are: we are healthier than ever before; we are much wealthier on average than
any previous generation; we have paid our health insurance over years; we have
been active contributors to society throughout our lives and we will cost
society less the more we look after ourselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Significantly,
we are better informed about healthcare options and politically much more
influential than the aged have been before us. And we are capable of continuing
to contribute productively to our own upkeep. It is neglect and ignorance that
is turning us into a burden: the language used in this discussion has to
change.</span></p>
