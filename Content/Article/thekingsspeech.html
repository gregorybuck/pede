film starring Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush, is a brilliant case study of a man
with a speech defect who is helped to overcome his lifelong trauma. The film
deserves attention not only because of its artistic merits, but because it
depicts, in compelling terms, a disability that receives little attention; the
suffering experienced by those who cannot speak freely.</span></p>

pathology is a complex medical discipline in which misdiagnosis and
mistreatment are common. For those with speech impediments, speaking is a
nightmare, engaging in social conversation near impossible, and interviewing
for a job a humiliation. Sir Keith Murdoch was a stutterer and as a boy would
buy his train ticket by pushing a note across to the ticket seller.</span></p>

Logue, an Australian drama teacher and elocutionist with no medical training,
but with the chutzpah to set himself up in London's Harley Street, is recruited
to help him. Logue has belief in himself and his experimental methods, which
the experts of the day had no knowledge of, and he convinces the Duke to trust
him. He knows the only way to success is through a partnership and dogged,
hard, consistent work by the Duke himself if there is to be any chance of
success. Logue has been given the challenge of a lifetime and an opportunity to
prove his methods with a man whose recovery is important for a nation.</span></p>

therapy was in its infancy in the 1930s. The theories of Freud, who died in
1939, dominated thinking about the brain and behaviour. Stammers were
considered to be psychological, not physical. Speech experts jumped on the
notion that psychological problems were the cause. When the impediment becomes
the patient's fault, the doctor is off the hook; misdiagnosis, mistreatment and
suffering follow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>It
was not until the mid 20th-century that speech phonation was understood. We now
know anxiety makes a stammer worse, alcohol helps make it better. Physical and
psychological knowledge is required to diagnose and treat speech problems.</span></p>

per cent of adult populations are stutterers. Refereed journals list up to 28
causes of stuttering and there are many other speech disorders that also
involve the function of the larynx.</span></p>

lost my voice in 1976. After two years of mismanagement, I was the first
Australian to be diagnosed with spasmodic dysphonia (SD), a crippling speech
disorder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:

after, a speech clinic was established at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney,
where a distinguished doctor had come down with the same problem. In the past
20 years, a revolutionary treatment has been available which allows ease in
speaking. The ''cure'' is an injection into the vocal chords of a deadly
poison, botulinum toxin, which most people know as a cosmetic treatment for
wrinkles.</span></p>

stops the involuntary spasm in the vocal chords that characterises SD. But its
effect is temporary and must be repeated every few months. For some, Botox
produces such relief they can't stop talking for days.</span></p>

an effort to understand SD better, Don Edgar and I undertook a study of the 133
known patients in support groups in Melbourne and Sydney in 1995.&#160;

impact on their lives from the disability was found universally to be one of
serious social dysfunction and depression with a negative impact on their work
and family life. Only 10.5 per cent were correctly diagnosed by their doctors;
for the others, diagnosis was a long, frustrating process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:

therapy lacks status in the medical profession and in the wider community and
is under-resourced. It is claimed on Wikipedia that up to 90 per cent of people
have some form of speech dysfunction, but speech issues are given little
consideration by the education system. Medically, the treatment a patient
receives depends very much on the luck of the draw.</span></p>

was successful because he removed all sense of self-blame from the Duke's mind.
He corrected the physical problem - the Duke's breathing - and helped him to
relax using a variety of techniques. Logue adopted a psycho-social approach in
an era when behaviourism was believed to be the only way to go. With his
experimental techniques and no medical training, Logue was an innovative
pioneer in speech diagnosis and treatment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:

today, the speech diagnosticians often get things wrong and the resulting
suffering is acute. Botox has made a dramatic difference for some and 20 years
of Botox in 2011 is a date to celebrate for those with SD.</span></p>

It is important for doctors to be reminded, and sufferers to know, they are
most likely dealing with a physiologically based medical problem, not a
psychologically caused weakness. You don't have to be a king to suffer the
torments of hell when you can't speak, but it takes a king for a story about a
stammerer to warrant attention.</span></p>
