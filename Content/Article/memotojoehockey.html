<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>It's ironic
that John Howard was lampooned as the ''white picket fence family'' man. At
least he got it – families (in all their variety) always carry the load and
need support. Howard, after some convincing, finally put balancing work and
family at the centre of his policy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>I wonder if
Joe Hockey (who apparently hadn't seen his son for three weeks while he
prepared a budget that will harm many families) has any idea that its very
purpose is to help families and their offspring? It's all very well to stimulate
the economy and get the deficit back into balance, but the real heavy lifting
happens now, every day, inside ordinary family life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Who does he
think looks after children; shelters, feeds, socialises and protects them? The
mums and dads trying to earn an income in a marketplace economy that is still
inflexible, biased against pregnant women, hostile to childcare and aimed at
driving down wages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>We now have a
quarter of all couples with children where both work full time; 36 per cent
with one full-time and the other part-time. Yet this budget neglects childcare
and offers a paid parental leave scheme that favours the rich, and only for six
months anyway. Moreover, John Howard's Family Tax Benefits (sometimes derided
as middle-class welfare) will be reduced. A sole-earner family earning less
than $100,000 will lose FTB Part B and indexation is frozen for both Parts A
and B. A low-income single parent will get a new $750 FTB allowance for each
child between six and 12 but will lose their FTB Part B (worth up to $3018 a
year) after the child turns six. Disability support will also be cut, again
undermining the capacity of families to carry their caring load. A visit to the
doctor will incur a co-payment of $7, something any family with children who
get sick often will find an increasing burden.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Supposedly,
the aim is to drive more mothers into the workforce, but where are the jobs (or
any budget incentives to create more jobs)? And where is the childcare
necessary for both the parent's sense of ease and the child's well-being and
optimal development? The childcare rebate remains at $7500 per child but FTB
Part A has its income threshold capped at $94,316 no matter how many kids you
have. What Hockey forgets is that most non-parental childcare (87 per cent) is
already done by grandparents – the larger extended family carries the load.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Hockey is
also telling older people that they will have to work longer, as if childcare
or caring for an ageing partner is not work. Informal childcare (along with
other voluntary work which contributes some $74.5 &nbsp;billion to the national
economy) is not regarded as ''work'', and not counted as part of the GDP. It
should be because that would show clearly that ''unemployed'' older people are
already both sharing the load and helping the economy along. The budget offers
employers a wage subsidy for taking on people over 50 (is that their definition
of ''old'' now?), but refuses to acknowledge the real work, the ''heavy
lifting'' that older family members are already doing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Hockey is
also telling families they, not government, should be responsible for their
youthful offspring. Young unemployed people will get no benefits for the first
six months, will have to work for the dole 25 hours a week, and if no job is
found go back to another six months with no support at all. Before age 25, no
Newstart (dole) payment, just Youth Allowance. That's about $100 less per
fortnight; try living on that, even with parental support.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>With the
decline in low-skilled jobs and demand for higher qualifications, 30 per cent
of young adults aged 18-34 are still living at home with parents. With youth
unemployment already at more than 16 per cent in some areas, who does Hockey
think is providing for them? It's families, stupid! Budget cutbacks mean such
young people will have less money to help pay their board, or their travel in
search of jobs or interviews.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>And who
carries the so-called burden of old people? Again, Joe, it's families, mostly
the older people themselves. Only 5 per cent of those aged over 65 live in aged
care accommodation; the rest prefer to live independently or are cared for at
home by their families. We call them ''the sandwich generation'', not selfish
Baby boomers. A retirement age of 70 is not unreasonable for those who have
white collar jobs, but try still digging ditches, or climbing bridge rigging,
or even teaching noisy classes of schoolchildren at that age. Already, many
older people are in the paid labour force: 71 per cent of those aged 55 to 59,
51 per cent at age 60 to 64; 24 per cent of 65 to 69 year-olds; and 5 per cent
of those over 70. Yet age discrimination kicks in at age 45, so employers need
re-education, not just an incentive grant for employing older people, though
that's a start. The Government's rhetoric about ''the crisis of ageing'' works
against more positive attitudes to the aged; the whole culture needs to change.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Tony Abbott
and his hard-hearted pals should recite Roosevelt's mantra about the role of
good government: family and individual security requires government recognition
of the right to a good education, a useful and remunerative job, adequate food
and clothing, a decent home, adequate medical care, and the right to protection
from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident and unemployment. Any
measure that affects families' abilities to live up to such standards is a blot
on Australia's future.</span></p>
