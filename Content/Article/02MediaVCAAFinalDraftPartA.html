    <p><strong>PART A &ndash;</strong><strong>Today&rsquo;s technology</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>CURRENT SITUATION </strong><strong> </strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Television, film  and computer games are already playing a role in educating young children but  there is significant potential to capitalise on their ability to enhance  development and learning. </p>
    <p>Media technology is  pervasive and covers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>radio and television  broadcasting on in-house sets, iPods and portable players or on mobile phones</li>
        <li>films and TV programs broadcast  or on DVDs</li>
        <li>computer games on PCs, laptops  or hand-held modules and interactive games on the internet</li>
        <li>communicative media such as chat rooms, mobiles and email. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This paper  focuses primarily on children under the age of eight who are less involved with  the communicative media.</p>
    <p>Research  suggests most children acquire many of their media  literacy functional skills early and without much formal instruction.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Children under  age 6 already have good media skills  &ndash; by themselves:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>74% can turn on the TV</li>
        <li>58% can use the remote</li>
        <li>46% can put on a video or DVD.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A recent Australian  Communications and Media Authority survey  of media use (ACMA, 2007) found that  children aged 0-4 spent:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>154 minutes per day viewing  free-to-air television (127 minutes on commercial channels)</li>
        <li>194 minutes per day watching  subscription TV. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>That makes a  total viewing time average of 5 hours 48 minutes per day for the youngest  children who are the heaviest viewers of television in the family. Programs  made for these children are often inadequate and the children are regularly  viewing adult programs for much of the day. </p>
    <p>Comparable figures  for 5-12 year olds were:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>130 minutes per day viewing  free-to-air</li>
        <li>160 minutes for subscription TV.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This represents  a total viewing time average of 4 hours 50 minutes per day. This average is  arguably too much for young children who need a variety of physical and social  experiences for healthy development. Averages also hide the extensive viewing  by children at the upper limit of the normal distribution curve that takes up a  large proportion of a child&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The Australian Institute of Family Studies&rsquo; Longitudinal Study of  Australian Children (LSAC) provides an indication of variations in media use by different  social groups in Australia.  For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>four-year-old children of  parents with a higher education spend less time watching TV than those in low  education households </li>
        <li>girls watch less than boys</li>
        <li>children watch 9-15 minutes  more TV per day if the mother is not employed </li>
        <li>children in one-parent  households watch more than those in two-parent families. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Between 2000 and  2005, young children&rsquo;s use of computers and the internet rose from 7% to 23%,  with children showing a strong preference for educational interactive games. (<em>Children Now Report</em>, p. 10). </p>
    <p>The latest  figures on computer-based games come from a survey of 1600 Australian  households conducted by Bond University for the Interactive Entertainment  Association of Australia (October, 2008). This is a rapidly growing area of  media involvement, with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>70% of all Australians playing  games</li>
        <li>95% of all children aged six to 10 playing games</li>
        <li>88% of Australian households  owning a games console</li>
        <li>18% of Australian households  owning four </li>
        <li>1.2 million consoles purchased  in the first nine months of 2008</li>
        <ul>
        <li>TV-based consoles &ndash; 43%</li>
        <li>PCs &ndash; 39% </li>
        <li>hand-held gaming consoles &ndash;  18%. (Hill, 2008) </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>According  to the Cartoon Network&rsquo;s <em>New Generations  2008</em> survey, since 2004 the number of seven- and eight-year-olds surfing  the web daily has jumped from 7% to 22%. (Emily Power, 2008)&nbsp; The 2008<em> Norton Online Living Report</em> said 96% of  Australian children now find information for their school projects on the  internet. </p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>OPPORTUNITIES</strong><strong> </strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><em>Television</em></strong></p>
    <p>Television can be a wonderful story-teller.&nbsp; The  benefits that flow to children from good storytelling are many and television&rsquo;s  learning outcomes need to be considered as part of the 0-8 curriculum. Children  have always been drawn to drama over factual children&rsquo;s programming. (SPAA,  2008)</p>
    <p>Stories are the glue that binds the community  together.&nbsp; They give children a shared  purpose, a roadmap for their lives and teach them about their feelings, their  tribe, their culture and their place in the world. A cohesive national culture and identity that  requires development through education from an early age would not be possible  without shared cultural experiences which film and television programs enable.  That is why Australian and local programming is important for children.</p>
    <p>When done well, television programs can stimulate a child's  imagination and open up the infinite opportunities that life presents. Like  good books, good television programs can extend children&rsquo;s understanding of their world. Stories are particularly  effective in helping children develop emotionally. <br />
        In Howard Gardner&rsquo;s terms they develop their inter- and  intra-personal intelligences. Several studies have  demonstrated, for example, the strong link between <em>Sesame Street</em> and children&rsquo;s readiness for kindergarten, regardless of socio-economic status,  and those effects can last well into high school. In more recent years, <em>Sesame    Street</em> has gone beyond the basics of number  and the alphabet to incorporate elements of Gardner&rsquo;s &lsquo;multiple intelligences&rsquo;.</p>
    <p>Children will  watch good programs repeatedly, and keep watching them as they grow older,  learning different things each time because  they can engage with quality content in increasingly sophisticated ways. The  young brain&rsquo;s plasticity, its capacity to learn through repetition and  reinforcement and the forging of new connections, make good media experiences a potent learning and developmental  tool.</p>
    <p>Play is important in children&rsquo;s emotional development.&nbsp; A young child can try out roles not yet  possible in the real world; television can expand their world of play and take  them to places they could not imagine. The 0-5 age group is moving from a  self-centred view of the world to a more social outlook, so observing the  experience of others in stories on television can enhance their understanding of their world.&nbsp;  Preschoolers are also forming their personal style, their sense of  identity within their family, in a sex role, outside the family and within an  ethnic or racial group. Television programming feeds into this emerging  social-self and can be used to present a wide range of role models and images  that show different cultures, styles  and environments. </p>
    <p>Good children's television comprises programs made  especially for children that reflect the complexity of the emotional changes  within the age group and honestly deal with conflicts that such diversity demonstrates. These programs can help  clarify emotions, reflect anxieties and hopes and recognise problems while  suggesting solutions to overcome hardships and worries. In their early years preschoolers need  to be hearing and seeing stories which help them work through their fears in a  positive manner. They need to learn to share, to appreciate others, to know  that jealousy, greed and anger are feelings we all have that we must learn to  control. They are on a journey to discover how to connect emotions and  motivations of characters to their actions. Zimmerman  (2007) says programs such as <em>Blue&rsquo;s Clues</em> &lsquo;cleverly use the medium of TV to expand  not only the child&rsquo;s understanding  of, but also his or her interaction with the real world&rsquo;. Television is well placed to  provide such experiences. </p>
    <p>Programs such as <em>Barney &amp; Friends, Sesame Street, Blue&rsquo;s Clues, Dora the  Explorer</em> and others claim to combine more than 100 potential teaching  elements and enhance children&rsquo;s performance in social skills, imagination,  singing and dancing through active engagement with program content. Cognitive  gains include numbers, letters and vocabulary; social learning such as taking  turns, sharing and cooperation; physical improvements in small and large motor  skills; and emotional lessons in dealing with anger, disappointment,  feeling sad or happy. (Weber &amp; Singer, 2004). </p>
    <p>Unlike some  curriculum and media approaches  which rigidly separate what experiences are appropriate for infants compared  with toddlers and older children, the evidence is that quality TV programs and  games can be designed for three to eight-year-olds and understood by them at different levels. The younger ones take in messages  that match their level of cognitive development and older children interpret  them at a more sophisticated level. Technology makes it possible to design  programs that are not only appropriate to a particular age group, but also to  different developmental levels within that age group. The computer is  inherently adaptable to different learning styles, but there is as yet little  evidence of that adaptability being harnessed in the cause of more individually  appropriate learning.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Educational games</em></strong></p>
    <p>Gaming has come a long way over the past  decade. Early games were played on a dedicated  video device; now platforms range from personal computers to small hand-held  devices.&nbsp; Equipped with user-friendly  screens, mobile phones, PDAs, graphing calculators, GPS receivers, MP3 players,  digital cameras and watches can be  used to play games on-line or off-line.&nbsp;  This increased accessibility has helped create a huge explosion in  gaming, leading to many young gamers  drifting away from television to spend time with interactive play. </p>
    <p>Games can be used with positive results  to assist learning from 3-8 but so far there have been relatively limited attempts  to integrate game-playing into the classroom in Australia.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>There are games being sold to teach  times-tables, numbers, letters, reading  and comprehension. Such materials can be overtly didactic  with content that is little more than drill with graphics rather than carefully  and well developed curriculum content. Puzzle games, however, are now beginning  to realise the promise of technology and learning.&nbsp; For example, Nintendo&rsquo;s <em>Brain Age</em> and <em>Big</em><em> Brain   Academy</em><em>,</em> based around maths, logic and visual  exercises are research-based games that develop skills and they are regarded as  quality entertainment.</p>
    <p>Quality educational games can be  developed for preschoolers around shapes, colours, numbers, counting and reading.&nbsp; Games  are particularly useful for children with learning disabilities  and enhance hand and eye coordination.  (Novak and Levy, pp.222-3).</p>
    <p>There is now, however, a growing body of  evidence demonstrating that narrative-based games are effective and valuable  tools for learning. Narrative-based games  have an enthusiastic following with children from a very early age and across  all ages.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The iterative strategies developed  through game-playing include the following elements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>children seek information and  piece together data from many places</li>
        <li>they make decisions quickly which have clear consequences </li>
        <li>they become experts at multi-tasking and parallel processing and learn  to collaborate with others over a range of networks. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Game players can acquire these skills at  a very early age. Four- and five-year-olds play such games as <em>The Sims</em> (the most popular computer game  ever made, which is essentially a &lsquo;living dollhouse&rsquo;) and <em>Roller Coaster Tycoon</em> where the basic goal is to create a  successful theme park.</p>
    <p><em>Children Now</em> sums up the  research on children&rsquo;s use of interactive media saying thatchildren who use computers show superior spoken communication and  cooperation, can play better within a set of rules, share leadership roles,  take turns, and initiate interactions. Children learn to use more complex  speech patterns and higher levels of verbal communication because they tend to  narrate what they are doing as they play. They have better phonological  awareness<em>, </em>tell more sophisticated  stories and have better writing skills. Interactive story books allow children  to control the story and ask for help and get it. (Cassell, 2004; Foster,  Erickson et al 1994; Ryokai et al, 2003; Chera &amp; Wood, 2003; Lewin, 2000)</p>
    <p>For most  children, using the computer does not isolate them but helps to connect them  with others. Computer activity motivates and produces a longer attention span  and enhances self-concept and attitudes to learning because it insists on  mastery from level to level. </p>
    <p>In 2006, the  Federation of American Scientists issued a statement supporting the use of  computer and video games in classrooms:</p>
    <p>&ldquo;<em>&hellip;educational games are  fundamentally different than prevailing  instruction because they&rsquo;re based on challenge, reward, learning through doing  and guided discovery in contrast to  the &lsquo;tell and test&rsquo; methods of traditional  instruction &hellip; Games offer attributes important for learning &ndash; clear goals,  lessons that can be practiced&nbsp; repeatedly  until mastered, monitoring learner progress and adjusting instruction to  learner level of mastery, closing the gap between what is learned and its use,  motivation that encourages time on task, personalisation of learning, and  infinite patience.&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p>There is no research with pre-schoolers that  documents their capabilities with technology and the potential for learning  games can engender.&nbsp; But there is an  interesting case study reported by Professor James  Paul Gee, Professor of Reading, University of Wisconsin, USA:</p>
    <p><em>&nbsp;&ldquo;Gee described his nine-year-old son's  progress with technology which began at age three with him sitting on his  father&rsquo;s lap with one of the Winnie the Pooh books on the computer.&nbsp; The father would control the mouse and the  son would tap the screen. The three-year-old soon learnt how to use the mouse,  the conventions of a computer, how the screen worked and that some things on  the screen were clickable.&nbsp; Eventually  the child wanted to take over much more control of the game itself.</em></p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;Gee bought his  son two plastic Pok&eacute;mon figures from the supermarket; he was given a few  Pok&eacute;mon books, activity books and sticker books which introduced him to the  whole Pok&eacute;mon universe, including  the game. They got him a Game Boy but because the boy couldn't read he was  unable to play. His mother sat with him and they played the game together.  Pok&eacute;mon motivated the son very strongly to want to read the names of the  Pok&eacute;mon, play the game by himself and do a lot more on the Internet.</em></p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;By the end of  his first year at kindergarten the boy was able to read. He became interested  in evolution because of the evolution of Pok&eacute;mon characters. This led to his dinosaur craze and he went on to other games. By the  age of seven in First Grade, the son wanted to play Age of Mythology. His  father told him he felt it was over his head.&nbsp;  The response was that there were several children in first grade playing  it.&nbsp; And in fact there were. He and his  friends got books out of the school library &ndash; fifth and sixth grade books.&nbsp; They went onto a lot of web sites about  mythology and wanted to visit museums.&nbsp;  By age nine the son started to play Yu-Gi-Oh on Game Boy.&nbsp; To play you need to read the back of the card  to negotiate what you are going to do; this game playing is done in a very  social setting.&rdquo; </em></p>

    <p>Learning and Teaching Scotland (LTS) has analysed  the effect of playing a brain-training game every day on the dual-screen handheld Nintendo game console. The study, which involved more than 600  pupils in 32 schools across Scotland,  found the game improved pupils&rsquo; concentration and behaviour with less time needed  to complete the tests.&nbsp; The improvement  in the games group doubled that of the control group. LTS said the results  offered the first independent, academic evidence that this type of computer  game could improve attainment when used in an educational context.&nbsp; (BBC News 25/9/08, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/hi/scotland/7635404.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/hi/scotland/7635404.stm</a></p>
    <p>As a lucrative industry, games are  developing apace. As the production values of video games have improved over  the years, both in visual appearance and depth of storytelling, the creators  have produced more and more lifelike, complex games that push the boundaries of  the traditional gaming genres and  make them an increasingly important communication, entertainment and  educational medium.</p>
    <p>Through such games young people are  learning how to play, express themselves and collaborate in large-scale  communities.&nbsp; But according to Professor Henry Jenkins from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology there is another skill often  missing in games &ndash; judgment. Few children ask about the motives or accuracy of  the way games depict the world or the ethics underlying the choices both game  players and game creators are making.&nbsp;  This is a subject for a media  literacy program. </p>
    <p>Another area of exponential growth is  that of social networking and virtual worlds.&nbsp;  Social networking is used by children as young as 12 months old who use  virtual communication tools such as webcams to interact with parents or others  who are in a remote location. On <a href="http://www.superclubsplus.com.au/">www.superclubsplus.com.au</a>,  which is popular among six- to twelve-year-olds, children can build their own  web pages and talk in forums and by e-mail, with online mediators monitoring the site and ensuring that  content is age appropriate.</p>
    <p>It is estimated that  more than 200 virtual world projects are in development globally. (McIntyre,  2008) Children love the idea of virtual playgrounds, places where they can  create their own identities, or avatars and interact with others in new digital environments.</p>

        <li><strong>ROLE OF THE FAMILY</strong><strong> </strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>The family is the most significant  context for early learning and the home is a media-saturated  environment. &nbsp;Parents are doing their child no  favour by keeping them away from the internet. Technology is part of a child&rsquo;s  life and learning today and is a growing part of their identity, connectedness,  community participation and future civic engagement.</p>
    <p>Given the recent  research on the significance of learning experiences in the early years for  brain development, any curriculum for children up to the age of eight must  place a heavy emphasis on informal learning in the home and the ways family  members mediate the impact of media content and media  usage by young children. Whereas access to quality child care and pre-school  programs is unequal, access to the mass media  is ubiquitous.</p>
    <p>Increasingly,  television, videos and computer games are used as babysitters as parents have  become two-income households, with less time for parenting. Single-parent  households have increased; there are fewer siblings and neighbourhood friends  so media have become a companion for  more hours in the day than ever before. (Edgar, 2008) The potential of media is lost if children are left to observe  commercialised programming that makes little sense to them but is, nonetheless,  shaping their values and behaviour.</p>
    <p>At this critical  age their brains are being wired and re-wired, not just through parental words  and actions but through the repeated images, patterns, sounds, music, stories,  emotions and behaviour they see on the screens in their homes. The new digital media  are shaping children in ways their parents could never have imagined. <strong></strong></p>
    <p>Repeated  research emphasises that children learn most when their parents or other adults  &lsquo;mediate&rsquo; what they are seeing or  doing, whether that is on the TV screen or in the kindergarten classroom. (Dens,  Pelsmacker &amp; Eagle, 2007; Buijzen  &amp; Mens, 2007; Evans Schmidt, 2006; Barr, Muentener &amp; Garcia, 2007)</p>
    <p>The main point  about learning via the media is much the same as for any other mode of  learning:&nbsp; assistance from a parent,  carer or teacher needs to be &lsquo;scaffolded&rsquo; &ndash; in Vygotsky&rsquo;s terms, targeted at the learner&rsquo;s &lsquo;Zone of  Proximal Development&rsquo;, which is the difference between the child&rsquo;s actual level  of development and the level he or she could achieve with the assistance of a more  competent adult or peer (see Berk and Winsler, 1995). </p>
    <p>In the early years children naturally  love to learn as they love to play and appropriate video and computer games can  very effectively combine these experiences. Pre-schoolers are inducted into  many forms of technology before they can read, write or even talk clearly,  particularly if they have older siblings. With the  right software there are gains for pre-schoolers in intelligence scores,  nonverbal skills, manual dexterity and long-term memory and there are better  learning gains from home use of interactive technology compared with limited  use at school. (Calvert et al, 2005; Lewin, 2000; Labbo &amp; Kuhn, 2000: Haugland,  1992; Van Scoter et al, 2001; Frei, Su, Mikhak &amp; Ishii, 2000; Siraj-Blatchford  &amp; Siraj-Blatchford, 2001)</p>
    <p>Good programming can teach valuable  lessons about living in a community. Children need to learn that they are part  of a group; they can&rsquo;t always win and life is not a competition, that trying  and effort are admirable. They need to see human endeavour at its best, not  just the side that produces conflict.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Parents and  early childhood educators can control and regulate the amount of time spent  watching television or on the computer, guiding children towards a balanced,  responsible use of technology.&nbsp; Censorship  or banning is not effective because children need to learn how to use new  technologies to become effective citizens in the digital  age.</p>
    <p>An oft-expressed  concern is that of the link between children&rsquo;s viewing of violent television and  computer games and aggressive behaviour (Clements, 1994; Haugland  &amp; Wright, 1997; Wartella, O&rsquo;Keefe &amp; Scantlin, 2002; Calvert, Stron  &amp; Gallagher, 2005; Van Scoter et al, 2002;. Lewin,  2000, Luckin, Connolly, Plowman  &amp; Airey, 2003). Such causality is, however,  disputed across many research studies. It has some support if viewing hours are  high (Bushman &amp; Heusman, 2001) but other  family-related factors are at play and children are just as likely to be influenced  by positive social messages in television programs, learning and internalising  messages about friendliness, altruism, cooperation, self-control, delay of  gratification and the reduction of stereotypes. (Fisch,  2004) </p>
    <p>Children are not  just passive users, victims of media effects.&nbsp;  They are, today, active users eagerly exploring the new media technologies to learn about the world and  express themselves in new ways. The goal must be to help children make informed  choices about how they use the media  and for how long, and how much they can trust and be informed by what they  see.&nbsp; This is a preparation for a  citizenship model of media literacy.  (Penman &amp; Turnbull, 2007, p. 15)</p>
    <p>If the task of  early childhood is defined as &lsquo;learning to find your way around in the world&rsquo;,  then the mass media and the tools of  modern technology have the potential to help in this task by taking every child  well beyond the intimate confines of the family home to a wealth of &lsquo;life  experiences&rsquo; to discover who they are in relation to the wider human family and  their social and physical environment. Media  provide visual, verbal, emotional, social and even physical modes of dealing  with the world. They also offer a pervasive set of commercial values which may  not be what is needed for citizenship in the digital  age.</p>
    <p>The internet age  has ushered in &lsquo;a powerful new combination of technological, social and  economic trends which has placed children and youth at the centre of digital  politics, commerce and culture&rsquo;.(Wartella &amp; Jennings, 2000, p. 4)</p>
    <p>This is a big  step forward from previous discussions about media literacy that have focused  on the basic technological know-how needed to use it, a mechanistic, analytical approach, and a fairly negative form of  critical understanding of the processes of media  production. </p>
    <p>Ofcom, the British communication  regulatory authority (Buckingham, 2006) calls for media literacy in three main  areas, covering children&rsquo;s ability to:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Access</em> the media  &ndash; the skills needed to gain access to media  content</li>
        <li><em>Understand</em> the media they access &ndash; as  they develop, children must learn the difference between reality and  representation, how to cope with upsetting emotional responses to media  content, and to make critical judgments about TV violence and advertisements.</li>
        <li><em>Create</em> &ndash; a neglected and little known aspect  of children&rsquo;s use of the media, even  though children&rsquo;s own production of media  content is rapidly expanding with  new technology such as mobile phones and website interactivity. (Demos report <em>Video</em><em> Republic</em>,  Hannon, Bradwell &amp; Tims,  2008)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is a useful  framework around which to build a national approach to the development of media  literacy in all young Australians.<br />
        However, it is necessary to now go further  and add a fourth dimension:</p>
    <p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Learn through</em> the media - this involves  having parents, carers and teachers build on the content of what children view  to enhance child development and learning in the areas of physical growth and  health, language and communicative competence,self-understanding and  interpersonal skills, cognitive skills and general knowledge.<strong></strong></p>
    <p>To  fully realise this potential of the media as a tool for learning will, however,  require the development of new media content that will serve as both a resource  and an agent in the cause of a meaningful education revolution. New media  content is needed to deliver the kind of high-quality television programs and  games that provide rich learning experiences and so further the objective of  universal access to high-quality education for early childhood development.&nbsp; <strong> </strong></p>
    <p>Together, these  four areas provide the basis for a forward-looking framework that will address  the emerging as well as existing potential of the media as a tool for learning. </p>
