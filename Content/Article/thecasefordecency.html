going to war, rort the system, pursue power in a media sideshow; a toxic news-gathering
culture where police, detectives, journalists and their bosses collude - all
are connected.</span></p>

Howard Gardner, in his latest book</span><span style='font-family:inherit;

color:black'>Truth, Beauty and Goodness Reframed</span></i><span
style='font-family:inherit;color:black;background:white'>, argues these
cornerstones of society are under threat and must be reclaimed for us to survive.
Gardner's critique of IQ tests led to an understanding that every child
develops multiple intelligences, not simply verbal and mathematical skills. In
particular, they must develop ''emotional intelligence'', a combination of
insight/self-control and empathy. What the world needs now is more emotional
intelligence and an ethical base for intelligent behaviour.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:inherit;color:black;background:white'>Gardner
describes two broad types of goodness. ''Neighbourly morality'', which revolves
around the golden rule of ''do unto others'', and cultural variations on the
Ten Commandments (don't kill, steal, lie, cheat or freeload; honour your
parents). Children need to learn this basic morality in the family and then
apply it to people they relate to in everyday life. But the next step is harder
to learn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:inherit;color:black;background:white'>Because
the world is wider than just family and friends, we all have to learn to
respect the rights of strangers, to act responsibly, to behave morally towards
others. And we do this through learning the ''ethics of roles'' - the rules
that apply in school, in a footy match, in a job, where morality is not just
about your own specific actions, but about codes of practice. We become ''the
good team-player'', ''the good worker'' and ''the good citizen'', moving beyond
self-interest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:inherit;color:black;background:white'>The
real test of ethics is responsibility. In a truly civilised society, professional
codes of ethics regulate behaviour, ensuring we ask not simply what is good for
me or my clan but what is good for all. In a bad society, self-interest rules
and that is where we are living now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:inherit;color:black;background:white'>A
17th-century proverb says a fish rots from the head down. The rot in the West
is both bottom up and top down. Our young seem not to grow beyond a morality
based on ego gratification because family and neighbourly socialisation has
broken down and consumerism feeds our self-indulgence. Parents abdicate responsibility
to hold their children even to a neighbourly morality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:inherit;color:black;background:white'>Teachers
are told they can't enforce standards of conduct or performance, they must
preserve every child's self-esteem instead of rewarding excellence and effort.
And the ethics of responsible work are no longer being modelled by business or
political leaders because market forces fail to engender a sense of
responsibility for the common good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:inherit;color:black;background:white'>Teenagers
naturally begin to be sceptical about their future. Gardner's research shows
some alarming trends. Young workers seem to lack an ethical compass. Two-thirds
of them admit to having cheated in class; a third have stolen from a store.
Many want to cut corners at work, to take a pass from ethical work behaviour so
they can gain success first. Small wonder London kids steal shop-front goods
''because the boutique makes too much money'', or justify criminal actions
because ''the government lies all the time''.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:inherit;color:black;background:white'>These
attitudes seem to derive from post-modernist thought, where all truth is seen
as relative, standards are merely rules imposed on others, reflecting the power
relations of our particular time. It's not just poverty or a denial of social
welfare that is responsible. The old standards of religion, adult authority and
professional behaviour have been undermined. Parents want to be their
children's friends, not their guides and mentors. Schools are not articulating
any future youth can envisage for themselves. The workplace no longer rewards
effort; profit and exploitation rule. So why should a worker be loyal or care?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:inherit;color:black;background:white'>Youthful
indifference also derives from the way the internet and new media blur the
edges between mere opinion and established fact, creating, Gardner writes, ''a
world of personas whose identity and roles we cannot trust''.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:inherit;color:black;background:white'>It's a
world where journalistic rules are replaced by a culture of phone tapping and
harassment, where institutions are driven by greed, sensationalism and profit;
where corrupt bankers and financiers can be bailed out but ordinary citizens
lose their homes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:inherit;color:black;background:white'>An
ethics based on market forces will not suffice, for ''where anything goes,
nothing will endure''. There are standards of truth, goodness, fairness, justice,
excellence and expertise; they must be restored for democracy to function.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:inherit;color:black;background:white'>The
simplistic response of politicians and police to stamp out rebellion and deter
others by harsh sentencing is just a first step. We then have to reassert the
role of parents and other community members in setting standards, to act as
models of the good citizen and the good worker.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:inherit;color:black;background:white'>Companies
with practical work-family balance programs help the whole community cope with
life's demands. Parents who participate in local affairs set a good example.
Schools must engage every child, to ensure equal exposure to the skills of
competent and responsible citizenship. The new media offer appealing
opportunities for learning that we have not had before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:inherit;color:black;background:white'>Workplace
exploitation must end. Germany's social compact is one model. Instead of laying
off workers, companies cut back working hours then used money set aside during
good times to pay the workers about 60 per cent of their lost wages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:inherit;color:black;background:white'>The
Harvard Business School, which has shaped corporate culture worldwide, and
bears heavy responsibility for the global financial meltdown, has a new dean,
Nitin Nohria. He has been promoting business ethics. It's a welcome signal to
the business world, where greed and disregard for people in the workplace is
now endemic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:inherit;color:black;background:white'>And we
have to demand politicians conduct themselves as elected officials should, and
focus on the common good, avoiding expediency and grandstanding in favour of
ethical, humane, responsible policies for the future.</span></p>
