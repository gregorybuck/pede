            There is no justification for the Government to fund children's
            television and media, if it is not for the clear developmental benefit of
            children. There are ample other opportunities for children to amuse themselves
            and support for children's programming should not be about providing jobs for
            producers. What remains important today is the same fundamental issue as when
            we started in the 70's - the contribution to and impact of the media system on
            the young.

            Any regulations for children's programs designed in 2017 should
            be crafted to suit the media world children are living in today. The commercial
            networks are no longer fit for purpose. The programs they are making for the
            quota add little value beyond diversion and it makes no sense to attempt to
            change their ways now. We have done that with limited success for 40 years. A
            completely new approach to children's programming is required. That said, the
            $30 million the networks should have been paying for quota programs should be
            required as a payment to be allocated to a dedicated fund for a new service.

            The first group is the 0-8/9 year old audience where the
            educational need is paramount. These children should be serviced by programs
            which will support their development in the crucial early years, helping their
            emotional growth and readiness to learn. This is rightly the role of the ABC as
            our public broadcaster. These children are not a market, they are an audience
            with special needs. Programs made for them require creative teams who
            understand child development and see media education as a part of a service for
            them.

            Just as we need to subsidise schools, we need to subsidise the
            media programs that will support the development and enlightenment of young
            children. A program that is well designed and takes into consideration the
            child development process will enhance their progress more effectively than
            those geared towards commercial ends. As well, the children who will benefit
            most are those whose parents find ways to interact during viewing and take
            advantage of learning opportunities embedded in the program.

            Fifty years of research shows the children of low income parents
            enter school with poorer language skills than their more affluent peers because
            of parenting styles and home learning environments. By age four children in
            middle and upper class families hear 15 million more words than those in
            working class families and 30 million more words than children in families on
            welfare. The word gap is established by age two. If parents don't talk to
            children and read to them regularly their cognitive development is impaired. The
            word gap leaves children disadvantaged for life. Their early math and reading
            skills, emotional and behavioural control, and physical well-being are
            undermined if they are not ready for school.&nbsp;

            Neither government advisers nor early childhood experts talk
            about television, advertising, or the internet when they speak of early
            childhood education, health, and social policies. Nor do they apparently see
            the potential of quality early childhood media programs that employ drama,
            music, stories and information to enrich the lives of children to play a
            positive role in the development of the young child's brain power. We seem to
            have lost sight of the positive potential of the media to help children learn
            to understand the world they live in, and to gain some control over it. This
            enquiry offers the opportunity to rectify this serious omission.

            The ABC should be supported to cater for this age group by

            would be a major contribution to education as programs would be accessible to
            all children in their pre-school years which would help compensate for the fact
            that so many children are not attending preschool before age four.

            If the task of early childhood and early schooling is defined as
            'learning to find your way around in the world', then mass media and the tools
            of modern technology have the potential to help in this task by taking every
            child well beyond the intimate confines of the family home to a wealth of 'life
            experiences', to discover who they are in relation to the wider human family
            and their social and physical environment. Media can provide visual, verbal,

            The phenomenon of YouTube, reputedly created (2005) by two

            wealth of television drama series to choose from that was not available when

            are issues talked about everywhere. Children cannot be isolated as they were in
            the 80's when there were single household television sets and no social media.
            Today they are mobile, with a range of devices at their disposal and they can

            Their needs can't be fulfilled by quotas on the commercial
            networks. They need a dedicated service built from the ground up, a not-for-profit
            enterprise that can be funded from a variety of sources including corporate
            sponsorship. The $30 million from the networks, to be paid annually, should go

            The media this group generates for themselves is an important

            &nbsp;Media
            literacy would provide important tools to help children in this age group
            navigate new media and the internet which have thrown up new challenges
            impinging on their social development. Media literacy in the past has focused
            on basic technological know-how. A broader approach is called for today in four
            main areas which would cover children's ability to: access the media;
            understand the media they access - children must learn the difference between
            reality and representation, how to cope with upsetting emotional responses to
            media content, and to make critical judgments about fake news, privacy,
            bullying, sharing online, TV violence, advertisements and branding. They need
            to learn how to create. Even though children's own production of media content
            is rapidly expanding, there are new developments to master with smart mobile
            phones and website interactivity. Fourthly they need to understand how to learn
            through the media in the areas of physical growth and health, language and
            communicative competence, self-understanding and interpersonal skills,
            cognitive skills and general knowledge.

                The regulation and the preservation of
                children's programming content is justified but with the proposed restructure
                drama quotas would not be necessary. In 2017 there should be a new approach to
                funding children's content. The ABC should be responsible for early childhood
                programs for children up to the age of eight to nine years. A new online interactive
                service should be established for children aged 9-16 more relevant to their
                needs and interests which is paid for in part by the commercial networks
                relinquishing their responsibility for children's programming.

            As a tool for the voice of children, as a tool for the education
            of children, as a tool for cultural identity, the media is unequalled. Children
            come to media willingly yet we do not use technologies to develop and teach
            children; we use them to market to them. In order to attract children to
            relevant, appropriate material that is designed with their best interests at
            heart, producers need to take risks and to engage with the education
            revolution. Children should be a part of that process.

            The importance of media in the education of children has not
            been well recognised by the education system because there has not been a
            whole-of-government perspective linking education policy and communication
            policy. Communication and technology policies should be seen as integral to the
            nation's education policy.
