downsizing. Their over 50 year old occupants plan to stay put, with good
reason, occupying 60 per cent of free- standing houses with back yards. They
are happy where they are in familiar surroundings, and many of those who might
consider moving to a smaller property are deterred by the costs of renovation,
agents, surveyor and legal fees, and the pernicious stamp duty payable on a new
property. As well, accessing their capital can mean losing their pension,
leaving them financially worse off in a smaller house.</span>

the messenger. Of course it is not valid to point the finger and blame older
citizens for 'blocking out' young couples with children from owning detached
housing in central suburbs. This limited supply of family homes has come about
through lack of foresight and planning by our local councils and by
politicians, with their focus on the bottom line, on housing for first time
young and single buyers looking for apartments in the inner city or moving them
out to the sticks with few amenities and a long commute. No one has been looking
at the needs at the top end of the market or new ways of adapting to our
changing demographic patterns.</span>

age group, with two or more bedrooms. The Birrell report states that Melbourne
will need an extra 355,000 homes by 2022 and Sydney an extra 309,000. As people
live longer and desire independence over aged-care facilities, they prefer to
remain in the homes they own, thus creating social dilemmas for the old and the
young. &nbsp;So we are in need of strategic thinking and creative solutions to
address the facts, rather than polarized responses by Seniors' Groups.</span>

14% were married. More are deciding they won't marry, nor will they have
children. By 2031 it is predicted the proportion of families with children (38

programs were started in 1972. &nbsp;The concept spread to the UK in the 1990's
and to Australia in 2000. Homeshare speaks to loneliness and isolation; lack of
affordable housing; relationships between people of different ages; quality of
life; asset sharing versus asset competition.</span>

one person to another, or support people to choose a suitable match. Low income
singles can be offered rent-free homes with senior citizens in return for help
with the daily chores. The nature of those chores is negotiated.</span>

innovations such as Homeshare to service mutual needs to help maintain neighbourhood
