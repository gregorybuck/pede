    <p><strong>Globalisation and regional governance   </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Dr. </strong><strong>Don Edgar</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>Alice Springs</strong><strong> National Conference on Municipal Governance, 2003</strong></p>
    <p>Australia  is stuck with a complex, but very 'thin' form of democratic government.</p>
    <p>We vote once every few years for a federal government remote  from the concerns of particular regions because of the dominance of cabinet  over constituency politicians and because of the central managerialism of Canberra.  We vote also every few years for a State government likely to be of a different  political color from that in Canberra,  with all the resultant difficulties of cooperation and coordination across the  federal-state divide. And some of us vote every few years for a local  government much more closely allied to our everyday concerns and quality of  life, but which is inadequately financed by the states and rates and not  recognised properly as the key to implementing change at the regional and  community level. Beyond those occasional votes, there seems little demand by  the wider public for more active involvement in planning, political policy  development or participation in the implementation of policy. And at every  level of government, central managerialism rides rampant, with scant concern  for the diverse needs of regions and communities in this very 'Patchwork  Nation'. It is a thin, rather than thick democracy.</p>
    <p>It is highly unlikely that Australia  will ever see regional government taking over from the States and local  governments - vested interests and tradition are strong - and we have missed  several chances to consolidate moves towards better regional and rural  development models. But there is no reason why we could not develop better  governance, better processes of using our tax money, at the regional level.  What is required is a recognition of emerging realities in a globalised world,  and a concerted effort to change the culture of governance to one that actively  engages the public in deciding what is best for their own present and future.</p>
    <p>We should not waste time on arguments about small versus big  government. What we need is more intelligent government, forms of governance  more responsively attuned to the growing regional disparities in what I have  called 'The Patchwork Nation'. The report to be released later today shows that  inequality of regional incomes has worsened since 1998; the top 6% of our  population lives in regions which create 20% of the nation's gross domestic  product. It stresses that competition in a global world is more between regions  than between nation states and we have to re-think our forms of governance to  take account of this trend.</p>
    <p>Let me summarise briefly the reasons why governance needs to  change.</p>
    <p><strong>Why do we need a change?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rapid  change &amp; complexity mean that 'one-size-fits-all' will no longer work in a  'Patchwork Nation'</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Departmental  service silos dominate thinking, so no holistic view or coordinated action is  possible</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Governance  is too focused on servicing, not resourcing and capacity-building</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Structures  work against whole-of-government and place management for diverse &amp; complex  areas</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Need for  power shifts in decision-making - re-build democracy and civil society</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;<u>Globalisation</u></strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>flexibility  &amp; adaptability vital to manage complexity</strong></li>
        <li><strong>competition  is less between nations than between regions</strong></li>
        <li><strong>local  &amp; regional grow stronger in parallel to global</strong></li>
        <li><strong>top-down,  one-size-fits-all, central planning and service delivery become obsolete</strong></li>
        <li><strong>turbo-capitalism  can disinvest anywhere, so risk-management &amp; creative destruction are  unavoidable</strong></li>
        <li><strong>knowledge  skills base is essential/ life-long learning</strong></li>
        <li><strong>globalisation  drives individualism &amp; democracy, undermines authority and hierarchy</strong></li>
        <li><strong>dangers  of new tribalism, so governments are still essential to set priorities</strong></li>
        <li><strong>but we  need new partnerships and a devolved regional framework</strong></li>
        <li><strong>need  governance more directly accountable to the public</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Public  service culture needs to be outward- , not inward-looking</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>It is not just Australia  that has these needs. In the European Union, the USA  and United Kingdom,  there is growing attention to disparities between regions and the need for new  forms of governance to help all regions develop and survive. The EU Structural  Funds are targeted at developing necessary infrastructure, such as transport,  energy and communication, modernising training systems, linking economic and  social development, and disseminating the tools of the Information society.  They are doing this through the decentralisation of policy-making, increased  funding at the local level, empowerment at the regional level to promote a  thicker form of democratic engagement, and the establishment of new  quasi-governmental bodies and private-public sector partnerships. The UK  now has elected Regional Assemblies to plan and link up community services. California  has enshrined 'regional stewardship' in the form of multiple public-private  partnerships, academic-business networks to stimulate innovation, and the  formation of specific local level agencies to develop and implement public  policies. <strong></strong></p>
    <p>The evidence of success in these  new learning regions is mixed, but highlights the importance of new approaches  to governance. It is quite clear that social networks, the relationships within  groups and between institutions that we call social capital, are crucial to  change and innovation, and that such networks can be strengthened through  better local and regional involvement with the </p>
    <ul>
        <li>use of resources, training and use of expertise,  direct policy-making power, local area visions and objectives, and coordination  between governments, business and educational institutions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Moreover, the evidence indicates  the importance of at least three areas of governance that we may need to focus  on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>education  and training</li>
        <li>child  and family support services</li>
        <li>environmental  protection and sustainability</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The first is important because  of the need for a strong learning base. The second is important because it  determines the 'attractiveness' of a region to both young and old, and  especially to those with young families, likely to be the most stable and  highly motivated workers of all. And the third is important because it is  mainly at the regional level that environmental concerns can be articulated and  managed, witness Land Care and its heavy involvement of local communities.</p>
    <p>Let me suggest a model of  governance that would incorporate at least these three area of interest for the  creation of learning regions. It would require the decentralisation of State  government to better serve regional interests and a whole new culture in the  public service.</p>
    <p><strong>New Public Sector - People- &amp;  Place-oriented</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>resourcing,  not servicing</strong></li>
        <li><strong>capacity-building,  not central managerialism</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;Premier &amp; Cabinet, Treasury  &amp; Finance, Program  Ministries, Regional  Ministries &amp;  Resource Zones</strong></p>
    <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li><strong>Premier &amp; Cabinet</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>co-ordinate  whole-of-government priorities</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Demographic  Unit(s) to identify diverse population groups and unique regional needs</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Partnership  Unit to stimulate new arrangements</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;2. Treasury &amp; Finance           </strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>fund but  not control</strong></li>
        <li><strong>$ to both  central &amp; regional operations </strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>3. Program Ministries</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Program  Ministers - respond to Govt. priorities and develop core program elements</strong></li>
        <li><strong>would not  control program delivery processes, but would be accountable for outcomes  across the State</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Health  &amp; Wellbeing/Human Services</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Lifelong  Learning &amp; Employment</strong></li>
        <li><strong>State  &amp; Community Development</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Natural  Environments</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Safety  &amp; Justice</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;4. Regions and Resource Zones</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Assist</strong><strong>ing  (?) Ministers, one per region (regions uniform across all Program Areas)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>organisational  headquarters in regions, plus staff</strong></li>
        <li><strong>close  links with all Local Governments/Resource Zones across region</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Community Forums for public input on needs and  existing resources (e.g. Regional Education Councils; Family Community Forums;  Sustainable Development Agencies)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Analyse  (with community input) gaps, needs, and design (with Area input)  zone-appropriate programs &amp; services</strong></li>
        <li><strong>buy &amp;  construct programs/services (based on core priorities and local needs)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>control  most $ for programs &amp; services</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Even if such a model were not  feasible, we need to develop new quasi-governmental institutions to enable  greater involvement of people at the local and regional level.</p>
    <p>On education, It turns out that  universities in a region are less important than good secondary schooling,  though they have a clear impact through locally-relevant research and offering  locally-relevant courses of training. The reason why secondary schooling is the  key is that general-level skills, and learning how to learn are crucial for  implementing new workplace innovations and for the creation of new ideas. The  OECD evidence is strong that a successful learning region has to forge clear  links between local economic demand and the forms of education and training  being offered to both young students and in-service training. As well, it  highlights the significance of organisational learning within businesses, via  mentoring, specific learning and training networks and more formal in-house  training. Firms have to rethink what 'worked' in the past, make the best use of  it, but also unlearn any dysfunctional practices they identify.   </p>
    <p>Now what does this imply for  governance as it relates to education and training?<br />
        In too many of our schools, VET  is not seen as of equal value to university preparation courses, and vocational  education programs, including short work-experience sessions, prove totally  useless in teaching students anything about the real nature of work in a firm  or region, or about the significance of on-the-job training, learning-by-doing,  and learning-by-interaction - the two ingredients of organizational learning as  opposed to individual human capital. As well, too many TAFE and university  courses are offered in complete isolation from the real needs of firms in the  region they serve. So what is needed is a more devolved, regionally-based  approach to the curriculum and training programs in our schools and colleges.  Though this frightens people concerned with equity and a national curriculum  whose standards can be assessed, it is the only way to make education truly  relevant to the needs of diverse regions, to illustrate the links between  school and later life learning and to change the emphasis from a culture of  academic irrelevance to one of learning by doing and interacting with others. </p>
    <p>We could have <strong>Regional Education Councils</strong> as  coordinating bodies for the design and practice of region-specific education  programs in our secondary schools and colleges. In fact, senior secondary  schools and TAFE Colleges would be better off united as <strong>Community Colleges</strong>, where adults and youth interact, vocational and  more general education are integrated and business, educators and the wider  community can discuss and be engaged in devising programs that best meet the  learning needs of their own region.</p>
    <p>The second area of governance that looms large in the  literature on learning regions is that of child and family (human) services.  The overall goal has to be to enhance the attractiveness of different regions  in order to attract talent and those with an innovative, entrepreneurial drive.  Much has been made in the media in recent days of the report's finding that the  proportion of 'creative' people - bohemians, arts, music, gays, etc. - is in  direct proportion to a region's innovative capacity. But you're not going to be  able to attract the bohemians to every remote region of Australia.  So instead, we should keep in mind the evidence of population drift in search  of 'lifestyle'. Young people are pulled to the core metro regions (despite  higher housing costs and debt), thus depleting the innovation base of country  regions, because they want excitement and social contacts, let alone because  they can't do the college courses they want in their own region. In contrast,  older people are moving to the so-called 'lifestyle' regions, often because  they can't get jobs in their own region and they want a better environment in  which to live. Because many of the old are on benefits, this increases the  lifestyle regions' dependency base, and they do not find a better lifestyle  anyway because they have lost their social networks. </p>
    <p>Governments cannot completely eradicate inequality, but  better governance at the regional and local levels could certainly better meet  the lifestyle needs of both young and old, enhancing the attractiveness of  regions so they retain and attract creative human capital. Young families in  particular are looking for a level of support not currently provided by  government at any level. This is not just child care, it is aged care support,  out-of-school hours support, youth services, recreation and the arts rather  than just sports grounds, cafes and meeting places where they can mix  informally, shopping centres, parks and gardens that are child-friendly,  family-friendly in every way. Older people need much better help in living  independently in their own homes, or at least in their own communities, and  local plus state governments could do much better than they do at present to  provide such support. As Richard Florida puts it, 'quality of place' depends on </p>
    <p><strong>Quality of place =</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>what's there? - the built and natural environment</strong></li>
        <li><strong>who's there? - diverse people, creative capital</strong></li>
        <li><strong>what's going on? - vibrancy of community life</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following is a model I have suggested for the better  administration of human services at the regional level.</p>
    <p><strong>Regions &amp; Family Resource Zones</strong></p>
    <p><strong>(built variably round  clusters of schools, child care centres,, local councils, health &amp; other  services - pooling community resources)</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Govt. sets policy  priorities, broad goals &amp; accountability guidelines only; </strong><br />
        <strong>local needs &amp;  suitable programs decided by</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Family Community Forums</strong></p>
    <p><strong>and delivered through</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Family Resource Centres</strong></p>
    <p><strong>(could be Primary  Schools as Family Learning Centres, child care centres, local &amp; regional  libraries, linked by technology and staffed with Facilitators)</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Schools act as vital  inter-generational link points</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Family Learning Centres - Primary Schools</strong><br />
        <strong>Youth Education Hubs - Middle Schools</strong><br />
        <strong>Community Colleges (Senior Schools/TAFE/adult  &amp; further education)</strong></p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>To achieve such goals, governments at federal and State  levels must fund local governments better, perhaps by means of block grants  from GST funds. Regions themselves must learn to attract direct investment from  domestic and foreign businesses and other agencies. New legislation such as the  US Community Investment Act could stimulate this. But a central factor will be  changing the culture of the public service, because it is at present riddled  with an arrogant, we-know-best-what's-good-for-you attitude, and structures  which restrict regional initiatives and community agency. Let me offer a set of  new principles for the public sector which State and federal governments might  consider:<strong></strong></p>
    <p><strong><u>Principles for a new public service culture</u></strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Good governance enhances democracy &amp; civil society.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Public  services should facilitate the re-building of  community and a networked civil society.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Broad  outcomes, not narrow inputs should be the focus  of both policy &amp; evaluation.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>The  goal is to resource communities &amp; families,  not just to service them.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Management  is less important than supporting &amp; facilitating innovative community-building processes.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Public  finances are for community-building, value-adding  to existing community resources.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Cost-effectiveness  derives from flexible, locally-appropriate solutions; thus local control of and accountability for the use of public finances.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Departmental  service silos &amp; sections within them are  not ends in themselves, but specialist advisers to and facilitators of  community-building &amp; life enhancement.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Policy  should focus on desired outcomes, leaving  program design &amp; implementation to the diverse  community patchwork of regions/resource areas.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Modern life is too complex for one-size-fits-all  solutions - the key question is 'Where is the  community?' in policy development &amp; program implementation?</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Risk is  inevitable and to be welcomed - accountability &amp; evaluation of  processes/outcomes must therefore be looser &amp; less restrictive of innovation.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Recruitment to  the public sector needs to look for community-awareness &amp; experience,  innovative ideas, flexibility &amp; trust in people, not managerial or  administrative skills only; performance evaluation  &amp; promotion based on success in facilitating area-suitable programs.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>The  starting point is to assert that good governance is not about governing, or  efficient management, of top-down control, but about enhancing democracy and  re-building a civil society in which the goal is to resource communities and  families, not to 'service' them. </em></p>
    <p><em>Principles  5, 6 and 7 challenge some sacred cows of the public service - that only the  experts know what is best for people, that only they can manage public funds  efficiently and effectively and that management itself is the game, rather than  value-adding, facilitating and resourcing self-managed communities who  themselves control the design, implementation and funding of government  programs. This forces you to rethink the focus on departments, separate silos  across and within those departments and the current focus on inputs rather than  broad outcomes implemented in many diverse and innovative ways by the diverse  patchwork of communities that make up Australian society. Risk, creativity and,  I believe, cost-effectiveness, lie in a new focus on community-building, in an  end to one-size-fits-all, top-down services and solutions to social needs.  </em></p>
    <p><em>Think  about how such principles might operate within an alternative model of  government such as the one I suggested above. I do not believe you can simply  teach people a new set of principles, make value-statements, and expect  anything to change. Instead I believe structure is all, and we need to  reconceptualise how government departments and other structures might look if  we are to have any hope of achieving a new public service culture. As Principle  12 suggests, recruitment to the public sector would have to be very different,  because we would need imaginative, creative, adaptable people who trust others  in the community to find solutions to their own problems. We would need new  forms of training and re-training to achieve the sort of culture change I am  suggesting is needed for the good governance in the global age. </em></p>
    <p>To summarise, the reality is  that globalisation makes regional development as significant as national  strategies. The reality is that people will not respond to calls for change  unless they have meaningful involvement in the planning and implementation of  programs relevant to their own needs and interests; the reality is that without  control of funds, talk of participation is a nonsense, so some of the State's  purse strings have to be loosened. The reality is that education, lifelong  learning and an attitude to learning which respects tacit knowledge, informal  training, learning-by-doing and by interacting within an organisation are even  more crucial to successful regional development than are formal qualifications.  The reality is also that some forms of social capital, some regional and local  networks, entrenched attitudes and values, what we call 'path dependency', are  anathema to economic and social change; we will have to un-learn much if we are  to survive. And the fact is that good governance can and should move in the  direction of more local and regional responsibility and control of the use of  what is, after all, the public's money.</p>
