Commonwealth Treasury seems obsessed with the costs of an ageing society. The
&quot;doom and gloom&quot; rhetoric has spilled over from health care into a
debate about work and welfare. But the government is pushing the proverbial
cart before the horse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Policy needs
to catch up with reality. That reality demands a transformation in attitudes to
the aged and their working potential before their support structures are pulled
out from under them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Measures
under consideration to rein in costs such as increasing the age for pension
entitlement and accessing superannuation, means testing the family home, or
having those over 55 work for the dole may be desirable given we are going to
live to be 100. But Treasury’s narrow view is leading us up the garden path.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

color:black'>&nbsp;columnist Tim Colebatch described the basis of the Treasury
analysis as follows: &quot;In 2006 there were 14 million Australians aged 15 to
64, conventionally defined as working age, and 2.7 million over 65. The ratio
of workers to retirees was 5.2 to 1. By 2056, on conservative assumptions, the
bureau projects that those of working age will grow by half, to 21.5 million,
but the number of us 65 and over will treble to 8.1 million. The ratio of
workers to retirees would then be 2.6 to one. How could tomorrow’s workers be
expected to finance so many retirees, especially when those aged 85 and over,
with the most chronic needs for care, are projected to increase from 322,000 to
1.72 million?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>This is the
analysis that is driving government actions that are likely to hit hard in the
coming budget. What this analysis fails to point out is that Treasury is using
an arbitrary definition of the &quot;dependency ratio&quot;: the number of
non-working dependants as a proportion to the number of productive workers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>It’s a
formula of infinite flexibility, depending on the assumptions you build into
it. A lower birth rate means fewer dependent children and youth, lower costs
for maternity hospitals, child care benefits and schools. An increase in
productivity through advanced technology or improved management systems of a
mere 0.5 per cent would cover the costs of aged care and aged health expansion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Bringing in
skilled migrants may boost productivity, but since they are likely to be young,
will also swell the numbers of families with dependent children. And what is
dependency anyway, when we know the flows of both financial assistance and
moral support run from the old to young more than from young to old?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>What, even,
is productivity when the GDP fails to measure the significant dollar value of
caring work, voluntary work, community work, creative work, without which our
economy could not function, and none of which is a monopoly of the young?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Those over 55
contribute the staggering sum of $74.5 billion a year through caring for
spouses and grandchildren and in other unpaid voluntary work. Women aged 65 to
74 contributed $16 billion in unpaid work inside and outside the home; men of
that age, who are fewer in number, contributed another $10.3 billion. So the
suggestion advanced recently that voluntary work should qualify as work for the
dole is a sensible and positive one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>In Treasury’s
analysis, the first assumption to be challenged is that older people will not
be working after the age of 65 and the costs of medical care, aged care, pensions,
concessions, tax-free superannuation will all escalate. It is clear, given our
extended life span, that 65 years is far too early for retirement and the trend
is already for people to stay in work longer. There has been a massive cultural
shift. Full-time leisure is not as enticing as it first seemed and the global
financial crisis and loss of superannuation funds made for many a change of
heart. Early retirement looks more like unemployment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Before the
GFC, most women had retired by their late fifties and only one in five went on
working past 60. Now 43 per cent of women in their early 60s are still working.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
12.75pt;vertical-align:baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";
color:black'>And it is not only women staying at work in record numbers; by
2010, 62 per cent of men in their early 60s&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size:
11.5pt;font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>were still working.</span><span

color:black'>&nbsp;were working in their 70s, 80s and 90s, up from 59,000 a
decade ago.&nbsp;People are also retiring later. This revolution in the
workforce is rolling on rapidly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Economic
gains from this cultural shift will change the gloomy predictions that dominate
the debate about ageing and the economy. At every age, having a purpose in life
is central to health and wellbeing and work often provides that purpose: this
does not change with age. But the big problem is that it isn’t easy to find a
job at a mature age and in difficult economic times.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>The issues
the government has in its sights could alleviate the economic pressures very
quickly, but, and it’s a very big but, first we need to promote a culture in
which working to 70 and beyond is seen as normal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>The enduring,
endemic ageism of corporate human relations managers must be tackled as we
encourage older workers to remain in the workforce. Surveys have shown that HR
managers report they would not employ someone over 50, and 65 per cent would
prefer to retrench those over 45 rather than anyone younger, regardless of
their skills and performance. Ageism is holding us back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>As well,
economists have too narrow a definition of productivity, which is not useful in
evaluating either a &quot;good&quot; life or the functions that need to be
filled in our modern society. In measuring wage earnings and excluding the
value of voluntary work, the value of holding a family together, of caring for
others, of keeping life ticking along while others work in paid employment ignores
these roles that are the glue that binds a community together and makes for
quality of life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Many older
people have stepped into these roles as society has become more complex. You
don’t have to be a brain surgeon or even in full-time work to be a productive
and valuable citizen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>My peers
should be welcomed to stay longer in the workforce with flexible hours so they
can continue to support themselves and so their valuable experience and
expertise is put to productive use in this long stage called &quot;old age&quot;.
Then the economic reforms to pensions, superannuation and working for the dole
would have validity.</span></p>
