            The Commercial television
            networks are calling for an end to the children's television quotas. (The Age
            21/7/17) There is nothing new about that.&nbsp; The producers want quotas
            applied across all platforms. But the central issue governing children's media
            should not be to find ways to support an existing production industry or
            relieve the networks of their obligations it should be about how best to serve
            the interests and needs of children.&nbsp;

            The industry has always been
            hostile to the Children's Television Standards (CTS) since they were first
            mooted in 1976. They claimed then they did not have the resources for such
            programming. They asserted they did not know what a children's program looked
            like, that Australian kids couldn't act and they would not watch such programs.

            The networks have cried the
            proverbial 'wolf' for 40 years. First, they said the high costs of technology
            in converting to colour in 1976 would consume all their revenue. Colour brooved
            to be a bonanza. And when the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) set up the
            Children's Program Committee (CPC) to implement the Standards in 1979, the
            networks undermined the process by withdrawing their representative. Fifteen
            commercial television licensees challenged the validity of the ABT's power to
            classify programs, in the Federal Court. They lost, but pursued their argument
            in the High Court which held the ABT's Standards were invalid.&nbsp; So Labor's
            Communication Minister, Michael Duffy, introduced an Amendment Bill affirming
            the ABT's powers. Finally the networks had no choice but to comply or risk
            losing their license. This process took eight years.

            For the following decade the system
            of subsidy and regulation worked. Quality drama was produced which attracted
            the child audience and spawned both a domestic and international industry. But
            in 1995, with the best of intentions, the Australian Broadcasting Authority
            (ABA) made a strategic error. They doubled the quota and things began to
            unravel. It was easier to fill the quota with long running series and
            animations undermining the diversity of live-action programs. The bigger
            problem was that the Film Finance Corporation (FFC), the major source of
            funding for children's programs, was facing cut backs. In 1994 the FFC invested
            $ 20 million, 23% of its funding into children's programs. By 1998 their
            investment had dropped to $9.3 million. This was when the drama quota doubled.

            Networks, aware of this problem,
            drove down license fees and squeezed producers. The number of live-action
            productions and the number of active producers declined. The networks met their
            quotas but buried programs and did nothing to entice an audience.&nbsp; The
            problems were exposed by the ABA's evaluation of&nbsp;<i>20 Years of C,</i>&nbsp;released
            in March 2000. But nothing was done to redress the problems.&nbsp;

            Enter the idea of an ABC digital
            children's television channel. Big promises were made and exaggerated claims
            persist about this experiment. The ABC Managing Director, Mark Scott claimed it
            would mean 'the renaissance of children's television'. Prime Minister Rudd went
            along with the channel. Then the ABC decided they would have, not one, but two
            digital children's channels - one for preschoolers and one for school-age
            children. That meant 10,192 hours of programming to schedule across a year. And
            how could these hours be filled but by animations and low cost, studio-based
            repeat programs, which is what the ABC called for? They needed them quickly -
            'think adult formats like<i>
                &nbsp;Rove, Thank god you're here and Specs and
                Specs
            </i>' was the call. Some renaissance!

        <span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Noto Sans","serif";color:#333333'>
            These channels filled a vacuum
            for a brief time as they were the only free-to-air all day show on the box. But
            then, as those in the industry should have known, the audience began to
            shrivel.&nbsp; We knew from research studies, as early as ten years ago, in the
            UK, in the USA and in Australia, that kids were deserting scheduled
            television.&nbsp;

            This means the networks now have
            a legitimate point. The audience they have been running away from for forty
            years is running away from them. But the answer, as they are urging, is not to
            abandon the quotas and redirect the funds to prime time programs. They have a
            responsibility to the community, as licensees, for their privileged role. The
            $30 million dollars they have been spending belongs to children's programming
            and should be levied to help support a new service.

            And the ABC, now being
            castigated for reducing their program expenditure on children, when they have
            had $350 million withdrawn from their funding and the child audience is
            following the Pied Piper of social media&nbsp; should rethink their children's
            service. Close down ABC3. Consolidate and refresh ABC2 for 2-9 year olds, for
            there is no more important group of viewers deserving priority than those in
            their early years. Education does not begin when children go to pre-school or
            school for the first time. Eighty-five per cent of brain development takes
            place in the first few years of life.<b>&nbsp;</b>There is a great opportunity
            here, as part of the media reviews, to accommodate quality early childhood
            programs into the policy mix.&nbsp; This is a legitimate role for a public
            broadcaster. The BBC earlier this month announced additional funding of 31.4 million
            pounds over three years for on-line projects in an attempt to remain relevant
            for their child audience.

            should be accessible across multiple platforms accommodating distribution to a
            desk-top, online or to mobile devices. It should be a robust, flexible,
            platform that lets kids do what they want in the ways they want, when they want,
