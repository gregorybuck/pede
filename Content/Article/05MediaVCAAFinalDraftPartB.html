<p><strong>PART  B &ndash; Regulatory and funding issues</strong><strong> </strong></p>
    <p><strong><em>&nbsp;A  whole-of-government perspective </em></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
    <p>This paper has been  prepared at a time of widespread change within the Australian film and  television industry.&nbsp; The Australian  Communication and Media Authority (ACMA) is undertaking a review of its  Children's Television Standards.&nbsp; It has  recently launched a website to help people participate in and understand  digital media services &ndash; <a href="http://www.acma.gov.au/medialiteracy">www.acma.gov.au/medialiteracy</a>. </p>
    <p>The Australian  Broadcasting Corporation and the Special Broadcasting Service are also  undergoing reviews, taking into account convergence and digitization.&nbsp; The Australian film Finance Corporation, the  major funding bank for the industry has been merged into a new body, Screen Australia.</p>
    <p>The Australian Government&rsquo;s broadband and digital plans, the role of  ACMA and the reviews of the ABC and SBS are as central to the education  revolution as are the government&rsquo;s plans for reform of the education system for  early childhood.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>It is  suggested that the importance of media  in the education of children has not been well recognised because there has not  been a whole-of-government perspective linking education policy and  communication policy, although now the need for computers and for fast  broadband connections has been accepted. </p>
    <p>Health  policies for children have not been seen as a core aspect of early childhood  education. Child care funding has  been premised on helping mothers in employment, not seen as an essential domain  of early childhood development and learning. </p>
    <p>Some states,  such as Victoria,  have appointed a Minister for Children to attempt better cross-departmental  coordination and other states have a  Children&rsquo;s Commissioner. Such developments need to be carried through  nationally with the appointment of a federal Children&rsquo;s Media Commissioner who would advise governments and  liaise with industry, education and community groups in the best interests of  children and oversee the conduct of research on how the media affect children&rsquo;s  development and learning.</p>
    <p><strong>Findings</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Communication  and technology policies should be seen as integral to the nation&rsquo;s education  policy.</li>
        <li>The  Early Years Learning and Development Framework (ELDF) should have a clear focus  on informal learning through media  and technology.</li>
        <li>Media  education should be expanded beyond a narrow focus on media  literacy skills to include the content and learning potential of all forms of  the new digital media.</li>
        <li>Rather  than taking a narrow focus on students&rsquo; school readiness,  or their later productivity the ELDF should focus on the sort of citizens we  need our children to become.</li>
        <li>The  government should appoint a Children&rsquo;s Media  Commissioner to develop a framework for all government activity associated with  children&rsquo;s education, health and welfare with media  at their core. <strong></strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
    <p><em>Commercial  television</em><br />
        For thirty years, Australia has  had a system requiring Children&rsquo;s Television Standards (CTS) which are currently  under review. The overall goal of the CTS is &lsquo;to promote Australia&rsquo;s  identity, character and cultural diversity&rsquo;,  by requiring programs specifically designed for Australian children and  protecting them from &lsquo;harmful effects&rsquo;. In brief, the CTS require that  commercial TV networks broadcast annually 260 hours of children&rsquo;s programs (C)  and 130 hours of pre-school programs (P). Half of these must be first-release  Australian content; all P programs must be Australian. Licensees must broadcast  at least 96 hours of first-release Australian C drama over a three-year period,  plus eight hours of repeat Australian drama.</p>
    <p>Given the enormous number of hours  Australian children are watching (averaging over 5 hours a day), not much of it  is ACMA-approved C or P material. Even the programs classified as P or C leave  much to be desired.</p>
    <p><em>ABC and SBS</em><br />
        In October 2008 the Australian Government  called for submissions to review the future roles of the Australian  Broadcasting Corporation and the Special Broadcasting Service. (<em>ABC and SBS: Towards a digital future. Discussion paper, </em><a href="http://www.dbcde.gov.au/abcsbsreview">www.dbcde.gov.au/abcsbsreview</a>) </p>
    <p>The government is seeking to clarify the  vision and direction of the ABC and  SBS as creative and responsible public broadcasters in the era of convergence  and digitisation.&nbsp; This review will include an examination of  children's programming and the discussion  paper expects &lsquo;the national broadcasters could play an enhanced role in  children's programming&rsquo;.&nbsp; At the Australia  2020 Summit the  final report stated, &lsquo;the ABC would have a specific education role in  classrooms and across all industry sectors.&nbsp;  This should be supplemented by the ABC having a separate children's  channel.&rsquo; </p>

    <p>The Australian pre-school programs on  commercial networks and the ABC vary in quality and in the effort made to  produce them, but generally speaking their education curriculum is very thin  and the content is wearily formulaic, with on-screen adult hosts talking down  to children and behaving like children. </p>
    <p>Production values are basic; the scripts  lack humour, originality and imagination. Across the shows the content is  remarkably similar. The hosts sing songs and demonstrate crafts such as walking  barefoot in paint or constructing a clock. The stories are read straight from  books and not read very well.&nbsp; Any adult  able to invest 30 minutes to be with a child or group of children would be  better off reading a story themselves  or guiding play. These shows do  little to enrich, stimulate and excite the imagination of children as  television is capable of doing. </p>
    <p>An ACMA classification lasts for five  years and the pattern is that once a program is approved, it remains in production.  The other important consideration is that P classified programming represents  only one half hour each week day of programming for children on a commercial  television channel. So for most of the time on commercial TV, the pre-schooler,  the heaviest viewer in the family, is exposed to programming that was not made  specifically for them and the chances of them fully understanding what they are viewing are negligible.</p>
    <p>With ACMA&rsquo;s review of the commercial  children's television standards and the government's review of the ABC and SBS  there is an opportunity to change the direction  for children's media, implementing  reforms that will form part of the educational revolution. It is time the  objectives for children&rsquo;s media and  their education were brought together to enhance childhood learning. </p>
    <p>Australia has a system  of regulation and subsidy to encourage the production of new television  programs for children.&nbsp; The commercial  networks &ndash; Nine, Seven and Ten &ndash; are regulated by the Australian Communication  and Media Authority (ACMA).&nbsp; ACMA administers Children&rsquo;s Program Standards  (CTS), Australian Content Standards and sets quotas. </p>
    <p>In  prescribing CTS, the legislation explicitly identifies several areas to be  addressed in relation to children.&nbsp; These  are: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>the times at which children's programming  should be broadcast</li>
        <li>how programs televised during children's  viewing time should be classified</li>
        <li>the requirement for Australian programming  for children. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The CTS was  devised 30 years ago and have been passed on from the Australian Broadcasting  Tribunal to the Australian Broadcasting Authority to ACMA.&nbsp; The standards were drafted for a different era and were reviewed with a view to  ensuring they remain effective within a significantly changed media landscape. </p>
    <p>A draft paper  released for comment (ACMA media  release 105/2008 &ndash; 27 August) has proposed few changes and deferred an  examination of the future digital  environment and its impact on the standards.&nbsp;  ACMA is flagging an idea that classification of programs be undertaken  by &lsquo;a person or body appointed by ACMA&rsquo;.&nbsp;  The idea could have merit if the person or body were to be associated  with the ELDF, with powers to review programs currently classified.<br />
        The relevance of the quotas and the nature  of programming currently being accepted under the CTS, needs an in-depth  review. The history of Australian children&rsquo;s television policy demonstrates:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>that while regulation (the CTS)  is a pre-condition of the  development of quality children&rsquo;s programs within the commercial broadcasting  sector, regulation alone is not the complete answer &ndash; regulations need  continual monitoring to ensure objectives are met as circumstances change</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>quality will not be met by the  free market &ndash; Allan Fels, then Chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer  Commission made the case for cultural protection of children's television in  the context of competition policy at the <em>Australian Children's Television Foundation (ACTF)</em> 20th  Anniversary Symposium in 2002: </li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>&lsquo;It would seem that the  arguments that relate to market failure with regard to Australian programming  in general apply even more for children's programming (there is also a further  commitment that to a degree children's television can be seen in a broad sense  as part of the nation's education policy).&nbsp;  It seems reasonable to assume that specific programs targeted to  children, especially expensive to produce children's drama, will not be  produced in the absence of regulatory requirements... The combination of minority  audiences, advertising restrictions  and relatively high cost make children's programming commercially doubtful for  the free-to-air broadcasters.&nbsp;  Consequently it is no surprise that these broadcasters will try to  minimise programming costs and this is likely to be reflected in the quality of  the programs.&rsquo;</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>the best children&rsquo;s media programs will not necessarily pay their way &ndash;  just as we need to subsidise  schools, we need to subsidise the  programs that will support the development and enlightenment of children.<strong></strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is time to reform the 30-year-old children's program standards under  which the commercial broadcasters operate and to ensure that the ABC&rsquo;s  programming comprehensively meets children&rsquo;s social and educational development  needs. These objectives will be best achieved by bringing together media and  education policies under a coordinated federal government initiative<em>.</em></p>
    <p><em>&nbsp;</em><strong>Findings</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>ACMA  should revise the Children&rsquo;s Television Standards (CTS) in light of the ELDF  and consistent with sound principles of early childhood development and learning.  In particular, the objectives of the children&rsquo;s quotas for commercial TV  networks should be linked to the National Curriculum Framework.</li>
        <li>In  order to accomplish 6, ACMA should establish a new Children&rsquo;s Media Standards Committee. &nbsp;Its chairperson should be the  government-appointed Children&rsquo;s Media  Commissioner (Finding 5). The Committee would oversee and approve new  children&rsquo;s television programs, computer games and internet provisions for  children. The focus should be on quality and value to the healthy social and  physical development of children and building  on the learning potential of the new media  for children&rsquo;s own creativity and control.</li>
        <li>All  videos, games and new media products  marketed to parents for use with their children as Educational Learning Aids  (ELAs) should be rated by ACMA&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Media  Standards Committee.</li>
        <li>Clear  guidelines should be developed by ACMA to help parents monitor and use to  advantage the viewing and other media  activities of their children.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><em>A new  interactive educational service for children</em></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
    <p>The ABC and SBS  are independent statutory authorities established by legislation. Their roles  and functions are set out in their charters.</p>
    <p>The principal  function of SBS is to provide multilingual and multicultural services that  reflect Australia's  multicultural society. SBS has produced few children's programs and has no  regular children's television service.<br />
        The  ABC&rsquo;s Charter states that the ABC should &lsquo;provide innovative and comprehensive  broadcasting services of a high standard that contribute to a sense of national  identity and inform, entertain and reflect the cultural diversity  of the Australian community&rsquo;. It is also required to provide &lsquo;programs of an  educational nature&rsquo;.<br />
        The  ABC is not subject to any classification of its children&rsquo;s programs by an  outside authority such as ACMA.&nbsp; Unlike  the commercial networks, which produce no specialised children's programming  beyond their quota requirements, children&rsquo;s programs fill a large proportion of  the ABC&rsquo;s daytime schedule. On any given week-day, between five and six hours  of programming is directed at the  under eight audience on ABC1 alone &ndash;  from 6-10.15 am and 3-5.00 pm. Much of this programming  is commercially driven, supported by merchandise  that is promoted on air and sold in ABC shops. <br />
        ABC 2 claimed  recently that its children's channel was reaching more children than any of the  cable television channels. (Mitchell, 2008)&nbsp;  A total of 26% of Australian homes had subscription television by 2006.  (ACMA)&nbsp; Foxtel  now reaches 30% of Australian homes. These services include the Disney,  Nickelodeon, Fox Children and Cartoon Networkchannels.&nbsp; The ABC has  proposed a new ABC digital channel  which would carry 50% Australian content and no commercials (if promotions for  merchandise and ABC Enterprises are  disregarded). </p>
    <p>The United Kingdom&rsquo;s regulator, Ofcom has studied  the output of Britain&rsquo;s digital children's channels and reported that they show  many repeat programs, predominantly animated and from the United States, while  first-release indigenous programs by  British producers amount to 1% of transmission time. &nbsp;Australia and the ABC are not  equipped to do better than Britain  and the BBC in meeting Australian children's media  needs.&nbsp; The concern is  that the ABC&rsquo;s digital channel will transmit repeated programming over many  hours.&nbsp; Parents and children deserve a  service relevant to their contemporary needs, not more of the same. </p>
    <p>A recent call for new programming,<em> KIds360</em>, by Film Victoria, the ABC and the <em>ACTF</em> indicates they recognise that  initiatives are needed.&nbsp; They are seeking  a pilot for &lsquo;a live-action non-drama program that will excite, entertain and  inspire children across Australia&rsquo;.  Producers are encouraged to create concepts for young people similar to  programs created for adults in prime time that are currently being produced in  Australia &ndash; &lsquo;The sky is the limit,&rsquo; producers are told. &lsquo;Think <em>Spicks and Specs, Thank God You're Here</em> and <em>Rove for 10 to 14 year olds.&rsquo;</em> </p>
    <p>The problem is that the brief calls for form over function. &nbsp;There is nothing to guide applicants about  what the program should do for children other than &lsquo;engage&rsquo; and &lsquo;interact with  content&rsquo;. Emulating adult formats is not an appropriate starting point for the  producers of children&rsquo;s programs. There is a need to spell out the content and  quality objectives of media designed  for children to ensure their best interests are served in health, education and  social development, as well as entertainment. </p>
    <p>Alongside  well-developed scripts and creative development teams, there needs to be an  ethical agenda to challenge the pursuit of consumerism and personal  gratification which in many programs triumphs over the collective good.&nbsp; Media education is a mutual obligation that  must be shared by governments, parents, the community and traditional and digital media  because markets alone cannot be relied upon.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>In short:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>programs must have educational goals, not goals to sell soft toys or  designer clothes</li>
        <li>programs must be trustworthy and put the interests of children as  citizens above the interests of profit</li>
        <li>children must be treated as active participants in the production and  consumption of their media content</li>
        <li>to be effective children's media  must take risks, push boundaries, explore new possibilities, raise new  questions, challenge the audience to  think and act effectively</li>
        <li>children&rsquo;s media must be  multi-platform </li>
        <li>media producers must work in partnership with educators.&nbsp; </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some of the ingredients  of a new service could include: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>a virtual world &ndash; developed with sound educational principles &ndash; on the  scale of a Club Penguin and within a distinctly  Australian setting</li>
        <li>an interactive games platform with games developed by experienced gamers  working with educators </li>
        <li>a YouTube equivalent where children post and exchange their own  productions</li>
        <li>a library of the best programs available for children to download and  watch at their convenience</li>
        <li>Australian drama series of high quality &ndash; durable stories drawn from  Australian culture for all child age groups </li>
        <li>A major early childhood programming initiative to be developed as an  integrated resource alongside the new national early childhood curriculum. (See  Recommendation 12)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;Finding</strong> </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A new children&rsquo;s media  service for three- to nine-year olds should be established, which could make a  powerful contribution to the formal and informal education of Australian  children. The best creative brains in the world of media and technology should be recruited to design and  produce quality products specifically aimed at reinforcing the learning and  development goals of the ELDF<em>.</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><em>Funding</em></strong><strong><em> an interactive educational servic</em></strong><strong><em>e</em></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
    <p>In its draft  paper for a review of the CTS, ACMA put forward a contentious idea. A tradable  obligations scheme would allow a network to take on programming obligations of  another network to increase the amount of children's programs across a greater  number of hours. In a variant of this idea, commercial networks could forgo  their children&rsquo;s quota obligations but instead pay a tax that would go to a  children&rsquo;s production fund to help pay for the proposed new service for  children. </p>
    <p>The ABC could  be given responsibility for this new service as an outcome of the current  review, with strict conditions for  funding that requires the ABC to  meet the educational programming needs of the ELDF and produce programs to fit  with the proposed media literacy  program. The ABC should be required to lead and innovate. It should not be  funded to provide a digital service  that will recycle dated repeat programming nor should it emulate what the  commercial networks already do.</p>
    <p>Screen Australia,  which invests in children's drama programs, should be given a clear brief about  the programming objectives for such a new service. Programs funded should not  be required to be simply market-driven. </p>
    <p>It would make  good economic and educational sense to tie these policy initiatives together to  enable the government to invest in a service that meets educational and  cultural children&rsquo;s programming objectives.&nbsp;  With the broadcasting and regulatory reviews and the development of an  early childhood learning framework underway, the timing is right. </p>
    <p><strong>Finding</strong> </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The ABC and SBS should be funded to give  higher priority to children&rsquo;s programming and be exempt from marketing such  programs and associated products to raise revenue. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><em>A new television program for early learners</em></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
    <p>In  1989, more than 100 experts from differing  fields with an interest in children developed a major initiative for early  childhood learning.&nbsp; There were  mathematicians, philosophers, scientists, musicians, writers, illustrators,  poets, psychologists, sociologists, environmentalists, puppeteers and actors.  During three week-long workshops, the ACTF devised a curriculum and characters  for a new early childhood series called <em>Lift-Off,</em> which would be comprehensive and supported by parents, the community and the  schools. </p>
    <p>The project  blossomed as individuals with different perspectives, knowledge and experience  mixed ideas. A program was devised that became an exceptional success with its  audience, educators and  collaborators &ndash; and with the critics. <em>Lift-Off</em><strong> </strong>was endorsed by all State Directors of  Curriculum and the Curriculum Corporation invested in a comprehensive package  of materials to support it in schools. <strong></strong></p>
    <p>An outreach  program developed and stimulated activities with parents, children&rsquo;s  service-providers and teachers in all states. A total of $17 million was  invested in the television series alone.&nbsp;  It took four years and the program was an immediate  success. The plan was to maintain a weekly slot on the ABC to evolve the  project into a comprehensive, national early childhood education program. With  television at its core, it would involve parents, schools and the community &ndash;  it was an experiment for children&rsquo;s education unlike any in the world.</p>
    <p>But with a  change of administration at the ABC, <em>Lift-Off</em> was cancelled. Without a broadcast outlet, the project could not be maintained,  so a well-developed, comprehensive resource sat on the shelf unseen.&nbsp; An important opportunity to improve the  educational opportunities and experience for early childhood was lost.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Australian  children need another such project as the basis of their early childhood  learning initiative. A national outreach project should be  developed alongside a program to bring together parents, youth, elders and  children&rsquo;s services ranging from child care, kindergartens and primary schools  to family support services. The ELD Framework has to conceive of early  childhood development and learning in terms much wider than  professionally-provided services.&nbsp; It  needs to build on the wide range of resources, including the power of media and technology that can and do contribute to  every child&rsquo;s potential.</p>
    <p><strong>Finding</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The ABC should be funded to develop and  transmit a new program designed around the goals of the Early Childhood  Curriculum Framework that would be the core of a community based early  childhood project.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><em>&nbsp;Research into  the impact of new media on children</em></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
    <p>ACMA and Australia&rsquo;s media literacy fraternity has an important opportunity  to develop a new approach and conduct research that is meaningful and of value  to the early learning framework. It would address the content issues flagged  above, documenting clearly what children learn from watching and participating  in the whole range of digital media. </p>
    <p>Despite claims  that television violence causes aggressive behaviour and emotional disturbance in children, there are greater risk  factors, such as family disruption,  violence and poverty in the home, lack of friends and poor performance at  school. Parental values and the children&rsquo;s self-esteem mediate  what they are allowed to view in the first place and its effect on them.  (Edgar, 1977 and Edgar, 2006)</p>
    <p>The impact of  advertising and the vast market that has emerged to exploit children&rsquo;s preferences  from toddlers to &rsquo;tweens and therefore parental purchases is clear. ACMA claims  however, that the research does not justify any further controls on food and  beverage advertising which targets children. This is despite what is known  about increased child obesity, the consumption of junk foods, the sexualisation  of children and growing anxiety levels in young people &nbsp;(Stanley, 2006; ACMA Media  Release 105/2008, 27 August) </p>
    <p>It is not easy  to research media outcomes, especially with young children. It would be helpful  to have well-designed observational studies  on what sort of adult content is being watched by children in heavy media households. &nbsp;But when a researcher is present, parents are  unlikely to leave the TV set turned on all day or watch unsuitable adult  programs. &nbsp; </p>
    <p>It is also known  that parental reports on how much and what children are watching, or how they  are using their computers, are unreliable. Young children cannot be given questionnaires  or interviewed on what they have learned from their exposure to the media, although qualitative group discussions might be informative.</p>
    <p>A more  sophisticated multivariate analyses  of large data sets such as the LSAC study is needed that compares high and low  achieving groups on a variety of learning outcome measures. The aim would be to  assess whether controlling for factors such as family income, parent education  and home language, the amount and type of media  use has had an independent effect on their development.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>There are other  requirements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>More systematic research on the  impact of advertising on children&rsquo;s food, beverage, toys and clothing  preferences and use, plus how parents react in their purchasing of products for  their children &ndash; advertisers know which advertisements work so it should not be  hard to get better evidence on matters of deep concern to parents and the wider  community.</li>
        <li>Observational studies of groups of young children and their reaction  to a variety of television programs and video games recorded and analysed &ndash; comments,  levels of interest, recall of words, actions, images, characters, and  carry-over into playing or their demands on parents.</li>
        <li>Experimental studies using specially planned educational programs or  segments with developmental goals built in to test the effects on language,  cognition, socio-emotional behaviour, interests, curiosity and further  exploration.</li>
        <li>Follow-up studies after exposure to such segments, at varying  intervals, to see how long the effects last, controlling for whether or not an  adult has viewed the program with the child, talked with them about what they  have seen, and &lsquo;scaffolded&rsquo; the program elements with further learning  exercises.</li>
        <li>Controlled observational  experiments in child care and preschool settings where teachers use TV programs  such as nature documentaries, children&rsquo;s drama and music or computer games to  lead into lessons about wider curriculum goals.</li>
        <li>One-on-one discussions with children about current events,  sports, entertainment, nature studies  and personalities to identify from where they get their ideas, their sources of  information (correct or incorrect) and how they feel about what they know.</li>
        <li>More case studies of the type quoted above by Marc Prensky,  showing how young children develop their skills and understanding of computer games, their interpretation of media content and whether parental guidance makes a difference to their media literacy.</li>
        <li>Controlled studies of children in various learning groups,  comparing those whose carers or teachers have used television segments and interactive  technology to &lsquo;scaffold&rsquo; learning to introduce children to information,  concepts and techniques from the wider world of media  content, with other groups where this has not been part of the learning and teaching  techniques used. </li>
        <li>Systematic documentation studies of aspects of children&rsquo;s media literacy &ndash; ranging from simple functional usage  skills to understanding of media messages, advertising and persuasion, production  techniques, the impact of music and other emotional devices on behaviour, to  the creative use by children of new technologies to express their own ideas and  imaginative output.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Finding</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Government should fund ACMA and  other organisations for a concerted research effort to document the links  between children&rsquo;s media use and  their learning and development outcomes, in order to improve the effectiveness  of the early learning and development initiatives<em>.</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><em>Media literacy  for adults</em></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
    <p>Media use is  already widespread for all children well before they reach school age. It  becomes even more significant as they grow older. Child care centres,  preschools and primary schools must all take into account this media experience in their handling of curriculum  content. Educators  should encourage the use of appropriate media to take advantage of the rapid  learning curve from age three. </p>
    <p>Parents need to be involved in the  selection of games and in playing with their children as described in the Prensky  case above. &nbsp;Games for unsupervised solo  play should initially consist of simple image and sound exercises focused more  on developing symbolism than winning or losing.&nbsp;  Vocabulary is also of prime importance since the brain is ready to  absorb new words.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Adults need to spend time with children to  teach them how to use the internet effectively to communicate, to find  information and to be entertained. They need especially to help children  develop a framework and strategies for internet use that will ensure their  safety and well-being.&nbsp; In order to do  this, adults themselves need to: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>know</em> how to locate TV channels,  pre-record programs, set up videos and DVDs</li>
        <li><em>know</em> how to use a computer to use the internet as an  effective research tool and sift for accuracy and bias;  send emails and photos and download  tools to create content; use communication technologies with appropriate  &lsquo;netiquette&rsquo; and safe practices, including strategies for dealing with  inappropriate and unwanted material </li>
        <li><em>play</em> hand-held and computer-based games</li>
        <li><em>know</em> who produces various kinds of programs  and the purposes behind programming</li>
        <li><em>know</em> how programs are produced, identify  hidden messages and assess commercial messaging</li>
        <li><em>differentiate</em> reportage from advocacy</li>
        <li><em>identify</em> creative possibilities</li>
        <li><em>be</em> active media  users, not passive recipients of unsuitable material aimed at the child as a  consumer </li>
        <li><em>participate</em> and interact with children  in all media-technology experiences by  watching and discussing TV programs and playing computer games</li>
        <li><em>perceive</em> media  technology as powerful learning mechanisms for children with negative and  positive potential</li>
        <li><em>understand</em> that without an ability to  use the new technology, children&rsquo;s learning and development will be seriously disadvantaged impacting on their scholastic capacity  and work prospects</li>
        <li><em>accept</em> that the old days of chalk and  talk teaching are gone</li>
        <li><em>appreciate</em> that children have a new  learning power through technology but they have to be taught how to use the computer  and other media to their greatest  advantage</li>
        <li>undertake teacher training to provide students with support  to direct their boundless creativity  through new media</li>
        <li>become parental activists, demanding  better quality media programs  designed specifically for Australian children, protesting about their commercial  exploitation, demanding better regulation of all media,  including computer games that are designed with educational purposes and  consider children&rsquo;s interests.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Finding</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>A  systematic program in media literacy  and media education should be  developed and made available to parents, child carers, pre-school teachers and  other adults to increase their awareness of the positive potential for children  to learn and develop healthily through the use of media  and digital technology.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><em>The digital divide</em></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
    <p>Whether or not  parents can see the potential learning value of media  exposure, and what is called the digital divide are the main barriers to  children&rsquo;s media use, apart from  television which is universal.</p>
    <p>Technology puts  a lot of pressure on today&rsquo;s families. It is costly to be connected, to have  mobile phones, cable access and the latest iPod. The digital  divide is exacerbating inequalities  in access to good schooling and other children&rsquo;s services. Many parents are  pulled in two ways by the new technology &ndash; they fear its negative impacts: passivity,  physical inactivity, pornography and cyber-bullying. But they sense that  without adequate exposure and skill acquisition their children will be  disadvantaged. </p>
    <p>This is the  modern version of educational inequality, which has always reflected both  parental income and their perceptions of the value of education. The most  recent OECD comparisons suggest that the education divide  is reopening, with 7.2% of children having fewer than 11 books in the home, 12%  of children living in households where income is less than half the national median, and psychological problems rising. Income  influences what products families can buy, including  access to cable TV and the internet.</p>
    <p>In the United States,<br />
        &nbsp;<em>&ldquo;The growing importance of the internet has created a new disparity across class lines in children&rsquo;s access to  skills, social networks and intellectual resources. While children with high  household incomes enjoy speedy, pervasive access to technology at home and at  school (either private or affluent public school districts),  others struggle to compete for intermittent access to slow machines that are  outdated and erratic&hellip;. Those young children without access to the internet &hellip;  are considered to be seriously disadvantaged,  cut off from opportunities, unskilled for future work, and disconnected from peers.&rdquo;</em> (Montgomery, 2007, p. 210) </p>
    <p>There are no  Australian studies that break down children&rsquo;s media usage by race or ethnicity,  but the LSAC data on four-year-olds described above suggest that parental  education levels, family income and other factors such as working hours, father  absence and number of siblings do have an impact on their viewing patterns and  developmental outcomes. As Professor Alan Hayes puts it, &lsquo;While social class  differences are not evident in early infancy, by six or seven years of age,  developmental outcomes are clearly differentiated by parents&rsquo; social position.&rsquo;  (<em>The Australian</em><strong>, </strong>21 October,   2008) </p>
    <p>With the global  financial crisis impacting on Australia, that income gap may well become wider  and public institutions such as children&rsquo;s and family support services, child  care centres and pre-schools, local libraries and schools will have to become  key providers of access to computers, specialist games, and media literacy programs.</p>
    <p>Australia is a rapid adopter of any new technology, but there remains a  significant digital divide which the government is currently trying to  address. The number of dwellings with access to the internet increased from 35%  in 2001 to 63% by the 2006 Census. (ABS, 2006) <br />
        Nationally,  access varies from 66% of households in the major cities to 42% in very remote  areas (with just 28% of these remote households on Broadband). The ACT is  highest (75%), with South Australia,  Tasmania and  the Northern Territory  lowest (between 28-32%). As well, the top quintile of household incomes has 77%  with access compared with only 34% for the lowest quintile household group.  Those with post-graduate education are 83% more likely to have access to the internet  than those with no post-school qualifications. The unmarried, low-skilled,  indigenous and unemployed also have lower access. </p>
    <p>An Australian  study by the Smith Family found a new digital  divide between those who are part of  &lsquo;the new participatory creative culture&rsquo; and those who are not. That is,  inequality is not just reflected in relative access to and possession of media forms but a lack of skills and opportunities for  using technology for social inclusion. (Muir, 2004) </p>
    <p>If the new  interactive, creative technologies do actually encourage a new world of  democratic citizenship participation (UNESCO), there can be no doubt that  children who lack both the opportunities and skills to make their own informed  media-related decisions, or to  interact with their peers and express their ideas via the new technology, will  lack the cultural competencies and social skills that will be necessary in this  newly-emergent digital world. </p>
    <p>Children whose parents do not have a  computer, or cable TV or a DVD player, or cannot afford monthly internet  service bills will be at a serious disadvantage  and they need public access to and training in the use of such technologies. Gender plays its traditional  role as well, with girls in school often marginalized in computer use, boys  averaging a higher daily use and thereby gaining higher computer skills.</p>
    <p><strong>Finding</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Governments and education  authorities need to provide greater guidance to parents on the educational  value of television and digital media and seek ways to increase equality of  access to the technology.</li>
