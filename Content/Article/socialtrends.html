    <p>This was a major consultation report for Queensland  Education which guided reforms to Queensland’s  schools. It has been used widely in other states to rethink the role of schools  as ‘gathering places’ for children, parents and the wider community. It argues  that we must learn to live with complexity and become a full learning society  if we are to survive the challenges of a global age. Because human and social  capital develop within families and through wider social networks, our schools  must be re-conceptualised as just one part of the learning culture and become  embedded in society in new ways.<strong></strong></p>
