<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:

2012</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Today
I want to tell you a little of my story to show how a career can go in
unexpected and surprising directions. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Like
many of you, I was born, grew up and went to school in Mildura. My ambition as
a young girl was to become an usherette at the Ozone picture Theatre. My father
took me to the pictures every Friday night to see the two features, no matter
what. I loved films so Friday night was the highlight of my week.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Girls
normally did not go to university from country towns in the 50s but with
encouragement from my parents and one of my teachers in particular, I did go. I
was the first in my family to do so.  I became a high school teacher, married,
had two children and when they were 2 and 4 years old my husband decided he
wanted to go to America to study sociology, a subject you could not study in
Australia at that time. It was a risk but I thought it sounded like an
adventure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Don
got a scholarship and off we went to Stanford University in California where I
discovered I could study film and television. What an opportunity. I enrolled.
My advantage as a woman and wife in the 60's was that I was not expected to be
the breadwinner and therefore I could indulge my interests as I never expected
a career would result from studying film. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>When
I returned to Australia 3 years later I had a Master of Arts and was the only
person in Australia with a Higher Degree in Film. La Trobe University was
starting up a new School of Education and, fortunately for me, the new Dean,
Ronald Goldman, was willing to take the risk of appointing me to head his new
Centre for the Study of Media and Communication. I set up the first courses in
film production and theory to be taught in an Australian University. La Trobe
was the pioneering institution.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>This
did not prove easy. Despite a progressive Dean most senior academics were traditional
conservatives.  I was a woman, and women didn't run things in the 60's. I had
an American degree, so I must have bought it, some colleagues said. And you
didn't study a subject like film in a University. There was no body of knowledge
for such a subject and no refereed journals. I pressed on and in battling
critics learned a great deal about strategy and politics.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>I
was saved from those wanting film courses abolished, by students. It's hard to
argue against courses that attract students.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>One
thing led to another and in 1975 - International women's Year - I had another
opportunity. The government began to appoint women to statutory boards where
they had not been before. I was appointed to the Australian Broadcasting
Control Board which regulated the television and radio networks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>And
so my career led down a path I would never have anticipated - that of
children's television.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>I
chaired a committee for the ABCB which set up the quotas for Australian content
and children's drama which are only now being reviewed over 30 years later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>The
networks claimed they did not know what a children's program was. So I started
arguing for an Australian Children's Television Foundation to demonstrate what
a good children's program would look like. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Again
one thing led to another and I found myself as head of this new production Foundation,
now challenged to turn the claims I had been making into viable programs that
children would watch. It was another opportunity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>I
called on the top people in the industry - the writers, directors, and
producers - to work in children's television on two anthology series demonstrating
all the different program genres that could be made for kids: like comedy,
fantasy, science fiction, historical drama, contemporary drama and adventure.
These programs called <i>Winners</i> and <i>Touch the Sun </i>unexpectedly attracted
attention around the world and won all sorts of awards including an International
Emmy - only the second Emmy to ever be won by an Australian program.  Australia
was then seen as a producer of serious, quality programs for children.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>So
I thought. ‘With our credentials established, we could make a really fresh Australian
program that would be commercially successful; a program parents would want to
watch with their kids. It had to be a comedy as kids do love to laugh. I
searched, and one day I picked up a book of short stories by a writer called
Paul Jennings. I laughed out loud. There were no common characters, no common
setting but there were some very funny, outrageous plots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>I
met Paul Jennings, put him together with a very clever writer and director
called Esben Storm, and they invented the Twist family, dad, twins Linda and
Pete and young brother Bronson who lived in a lighthouse on Australia's most
spectacular coastline –we called the series <i>Round The Twist.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:
115%'> </span></i><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>It
took a year to get the scripts together. The show was bent, eccentric and often
quite lowbrow. Always a bit of yuk and a fair amount of slapstick. There were
dunny jokes, excrement, vomiting, embarrassment, where babies come from, peeing
competitions - the topics children's television normally shied away from and
model parents did not discuss. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>The
series turned the assumptions of children's television on their head and tapped
into life as kids understood it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>So
the greatest challenge of all was to find the more than $3 million needed to
make the first series. Every buyer I approached said it could not be done. What
works on the page can never be shown visually they said; it is too disgusting
to watch. But they were wrong. I did talk the BBC into buying it eventually.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>When
shown the series broke records in the United Kingdom going to number one as the
top children's show, unheard of for a foreign produced children's program.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:
115%'>Round the Twist</span></i><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%'> went on to sell in more than 100 countries around the world.
In Japan, Finland, Brazil or Zimbabwe; children loved it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>We
made 4 series and changed the rules of children's programming as other
producers tried to emulate the success of <i>Round the Twist</i>. Twenty two
years since it was first devised it is repeated round the world on a regular
basis. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>I
have told this story as it is about a program many of you may know. You
probably didn't know that it came about because someone aspired to be an
usherette and would not take no for an answer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>That
is my advice to you today as you enter your careers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>You
never know what may lie in store for a girl or a boy from the Bush.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Take
every opportunity that comes your way. And expect your future to have
surprising twists and turns. There is no single track in life. Opportunities
come unexpectedly from directions you can't imagine right now. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Be
alert. Take risks. Seize the day. It will lead to an interesting life.</span></p>
