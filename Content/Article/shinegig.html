    <p class=MsoNormal>When it comes to technology my four grandchildren, aged
    between 7 and 13, regularly teach me things I don’t know. For this generation,
    a computer is nothing special; it is simply another tool to master, which they
    do quickly. I’ve seen older siblings teaching preschoolers to operate a mouse
    before they can read and write. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>I have watched the four of them on networked computers
    playing Call of Duty and had a go myself. I can see they develop
    strategies and work out how to collaborate. Their dexterity, concentration and
    persistence are remarkable to witness playing Guitar Hero. They are highly
    motivated to meet the challenges games offer and to connect with their friends.

    <p class=MsoNormal>The extraordinary growth in gaming among children is a
    phenomenon of the last decade. Early games were played on a dedicated video
    device; now platforms range from personal computers to small handheld devices.<span
    style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many mobile devices with user-friendly
    screens – mobile phones, PDAs, graphing calculators, GPS receivers, MP3
    players, digital cameras and watches – can be used to play games off-line or
    on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This increased accessibility has led
    to many young gamers drifting away from television to spend time with
    interactive play. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>The evidence is growing that games are, in fact, effective
    and valuable tools for learning. There is a science to game playing. No one
    tells the kids the rules; they figure them out as they go. They seek
    information and piece together data from many places. They make decisions
    quickly that have clear consequences. They become experts at multi-tasking and
    parallel processing and learn to collaborate with others over a range of
    networks. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Learning and Teaching Scotland (LTS) – the main organisation
    for development of the curriculum – analysed the effect of daily playing of a
    brain-training game developed by Dr Kawashima on the Nintendo DS. The study,
    which involved more than 600 pupils in 32 schools across Scotland, found the
    game improved pupils’ concentration and behaviour. While all groups improved
    their scores, the group using the game improved by a further 50 per cent.<span
    style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The time taken to complete the tests also
    dropped from 18.5 minutes to 13.5 minutes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
    </span>The improvement in the games group was double that of the control group.
    This demonstrates evidence that this type of computer game could improve
    attainment in schools. </p>



    <p class=MsoNormal>The evidence is growing that games are in fact effective and
    valuable tools for learning. </p>



    <p class=MsoNormal>There is growing advocacy for the use of games in education
    from bodies such as the Federation of American Scientists, researchers, and the
    high profile Chairman of Futurelab in the UK, film producer David Putnam, who
    fears many teachers lack the technological know-how to be effective teachers in
    the new century. The danger is that they will try to adapt technology to
    reinforce old ways of thinking. New technology can, and should, encourage new
    approaches to learning and education. Games should be purposely designed to
    meet each stage of child development, to help scaffold learning at different
    levels, and provide learning content. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>It does not make sense to leave the development of media
    products for children in the hands of the commercial entertainment media whose
    game business is thriving, while kids are forced to 'power down' when they
    enter the classroom. If this continues, the disconnection between children’s
    everyday lives and their experience of formal education will grow from a gap to
    a chasm.</p>
