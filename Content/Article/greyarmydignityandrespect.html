<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>I was asked
recently &quot;Does ageing suck?&quot; The very question is an example of the
way discrimination works. Life does suck at times but, as a general description
of the condition of old age, it's a cliche rather than reality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>People talk
about &quot;the problem of old age&quot;, which leads to very misleading
perceptions of ageing and results in discrimination. It starts early with talk
of 55 as the beginning of old age. And this is despite the fact that, whatever
misfortunes we encounter along the way, most of us will live for close to a
century.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>About 30 per
cent of a person's likelihood of living to 100 is determined by genes but
several longitudinal studies have shown that personality, attitude and
lifestyle are vital in determining whether we will live a long life well. This
knowledge should be the basis of policy for ageing Australians.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>We must stop
talking about retirement and &quot;having a well-deserved rest&quot;. It is
well documented that retirement can lead to cognitive, emotional and physical
deterioration for many. People in a late-stage career or living an active life
after 55 still have much to give, even if they are not entirely sure what it
may be. We need to think about Life Part Two; redesigning and reinventing our
long life journey.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Health and satisfaction
in the second half of life are critically tied to education and engagement.
Education is not just for the young - it's a lifelong process. The brain needs
to be active and stimulated with rich, new experiences. What confounds the
brain enlivens the brain - even for those with dementia. This approach should
be built into our education system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Sadly, there
are forces at work in society that try to ensure our old age will suck. For a
start, we are told &quot;we are a burden on society&quot;, we are
&quot;unproductive&quot; and &quot;a pampered generation who need to get back
to work and apply for 40 jobs a week&quot;. Not so. Able-bodied people do not
want to sit around twiddling their thumbs without making a contribution during
what is likely to be the longest stage of their lives. Discrimination in the
workplace is keeping us out of jobs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>The
assumption many make is that if you are not in paid work you are dependent. But
productivity does not simply mean paid work. Australia's gross domestic product
fails to measure the significant dollar value of caring, voluntary, community
and creative work, without which our economy could not function and none of
which is a monopoly of the young.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>When
Treasurer Joe Hockey says people should work as long as they can, he discounts
this significant contribution. He should ask Treasury to do some sums on the
social capital that volunteer work produces and how that impacts the economy.
Overall, volunteering contributes more than $200 billion to the Australian
economy - more than mining, agriculture and the retail industry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Older
Australians are also told we will break the health system. This is simply not
backed up by research and would be completely untrue if the medical profession
moved away from medication and technological intervention towards a more
preventive approach. Maintaining physical health means serious illness and
morbidity is compressed into the last year or two of life, which means savings
for the system. So measures to impose higher fees for seeing a doctor and
increasing the cost of pharmaceuticals are counterproductive and will end up
costing the system more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Ageing
Australians are also told we don't look so good. A multibillion-dollar body
industry tries to convince us that we can keep age at bay with plastic surgery
from our eyebrows to our privates and beyond. Yet it is important that the
media portrays the natural character, diversity and beauty of people as they
age, rather than present us with startled clones whose eyebrows are half way up
their foreheads.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>And we are
ignored. There is no Minister for Ageing or a champion for ageing in the
Federal Parliament. Older Australians barely rated a mention in the election
campaign or since, except to be told we must work longer. This neglect tells us
we are not important in our society.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>The elders of
Australia can and must change these attitudes. We have buying power and voting
power. Women's Electoral Lobby made a difference to the status of women 40
years ago. Now it's time for EEL-Elders' Electoral lobby. We have a right to
be treated with dignity and empathy, not isolated and ignored.</span></p>
