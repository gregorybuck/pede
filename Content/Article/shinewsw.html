    <p><i>There
    is no doubt about the power of characters in a good story to develop children’s
    interest and creativity.</i></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Remember the Fonz in the popular television series <i>Happy
    Days? </i>When he took out a library card, the American Library Association
    reported a 400 per cent increase in card applications from children and
    teenagers. We need him to return, for there is no doubt about the power of
    characters in a good story and the potential of storytelling to develop
    children’s interest and creativity.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Storytelling through books and television used to be
    something we all took for granted, but in the United States a group of
    Hollywood veterans and experts from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
    fear its demise. They believe the internet, mobile phones, video games and
    multi-channel television are rewiring young brains and eroding children’s
    abilities to focus on complex narratives. They suggest YouTube has more appeal
    than a good film or book.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>These media certainly have become a focus of children’s life
    experience. They love the bizarre and funny videos they find on YouTube; they
    enjoy the incessant communication with peers while on the run, updating one
    another with viral speed. Even primary school students are discovering the joys
    of creating their own simple stories, music clips or slices of life to upload
    to the site and then study the number of hits they get. Young people have taken
    ownership of this technology and see it as their own. But this does not mean
    they don’t still love a good story.</p>



    <p class=MsoNormal>Stories are essential: throughout human history they have
    been the glue that binds us together in a community. They give children a
    shared purpose and teach them about their place in the world.  Stories
    stimulate the child’s imagination and open up the infinite opportunities and
    potential that life presents.</p>



    <p class=MsoNormal>It isn’t difficult to discourage reading when so many books
    are depressingly insubstantial.  Boring, technical, repetitive writing in some
    school texts; the sanitising of stories that once were meaningful roadmaps for
    life; and the lack of enthusiasm for reading when parents can’t be bothered all
    make it unsurprising that many children don’t want to read.  </p>



    <p class=MsoNormal>But read they must or they are handicapped for life. One of
    the most important teaching tasks in the early years is to engender a love of
    reading through well-chosen stories that will introduce children to the private
    pleasure of a rich fantasy world and motivate them to want to visit that world
    on their own. Developing imagination, Albert Einstein concluded, is more
    important than imparting knowledge.</p>



    <p class=MsoNormal>When I was a child, my favourite time of day was when the
    lights went out at night and I was left to indulge my own imaginings without
    interruption. Nothing was impossible in my dreams. I know now how important
    those times were to my development and understanding of life.  </p>
