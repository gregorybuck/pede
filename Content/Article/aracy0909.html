<p><strong><u>We need a New Deal for children </u></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the problem?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>We live with conflicting images of childhood</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I think many adults -  politicians, parents and public &ndash; are confused about children today. And that  confusion leaves change to chance, many children doomed to fall behind in the  race to become adequate human beings. It&rsquo;s time for a &lsquo;New Deal&rsquo; for all  children.</p>
<p>Adults drool over baby  pictures, despair over howling babies and recalcitrant kids, allow children to  dress and behave like little whores, yet deplore the drunkenness, violence and  premature sexuality of young teens. </p>
<p>In the UK recently, one  school stopped any parent from attending the school sports day because it could  not guarantee that an unsupervised adult might not molest a child &ndash; the child  as victim. </p>
<p>Another specialist music  school warned teachers against having any personal interaction with their  students, because &ldquo;adolescents may be unable to differentiate between fantasy  and reality. They may even be temporarily insane. They can thus present a  danger to even the most careful teacher.&rdquo; &ndash; the child as wild animal. </p>
<p>In stark contrast, a National  Health Service report on teenagers carried the slogan &ldquo;an orgasm a day keeps the  doctor away&rdquo;, claiming that regular sex would relax them and improve school  performance. No-one told me that when I was at High School &ndash; we all thought  masturbation would make you blind. No wonder parents are confused about  children.</p>
<p>Australia remains 27th  out of 43 developed countries on the Save the Children Fund children&rsquo;s health  and wellbeing index; the OECD finds we have among the lowest paid child-care  and pre-school staff in the world (and one of the lowest access rates, at  61.5%). Worse, we have 383,000 jobless one-parent families and 213,000 jobless  two-parent families, leaving one in every eight of our children to an  inter-generational legacy outside the labor force &ndash; and, if predictions are  correct, there will be many more. Small wonder that the recent <em>State of the World&rsquo;s Mothers</em> report  claims an alarming number of children are at risk of failure in school because  they are not getting the care and support they need in their early years. </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>There is widespread confusion about educating children</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We have heard much about the  vital importance of the years from birth to age three for proper brain  development: the infinite flexibility of the brain&rsquo;s synapses, the value of  exploratory play in testing life&rsquo;s hypotheses, the importance of a rich and  stimulating environment in those early years. So we have children being  &lsquo;hot-housed&rsquo; by their mothers, a whole industry of &lsquo;child Einstein&rsquo; tapes and  DVDs, playing Mozart to the womb. Yet our education policies barely mention how  parents and communities might nurture the brains of children by surrounding  them with imaginative, safe and stimulating neighborhoods or about how urban  design might play into a child&rsquo;s thinking and development process.</p>
<p>In Australia, we have a  so-called &lsquo;Education Revolution&rsquo; which is disconnected from the greatest  educator of all &ndash; the mass media. What children learn is clearly affected by  the media, yet educators often fail to see this and regard television, computer  games, ipods as mere entertainment, of no value to the learning process, more  likely harmful than helpful. But how children learn is affected by the media  and teachers face a real revolution in the child&rsquo;s growing ability to learn in  their own way at their own time.</p>
<p>We even have a new National  Curriculum Framework for Early Childhood (0-5) addressed to formal teaching  staff, not to parents whose interventions at home in those early years are  crucial for proper brain development, and barely paying lip-service to quality  media content for children and the way new technologies hold out hope for more  effective learning.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We have a dogmatic insistence  on testing children when the research tells us that testing narrows the  curriculum and reinforces family-based disadvantage. </p>
<p>Schools are increasingly  divided between those launching the lucky child into a success orbit and those  merely in a holding pattern with little hope of ever taking off. </p>
<p>And now we have Alan Milburn  from the UK touting &lsquo;pushy parents&rsquo; as the answer instead of a stimulating  community environment and a concerted effort across the board to encourage the  intelligences of every child.</p>
<p>Children are not simply  fodder for later productivity, to be trained in the skills we will demand of  them when we grow old; they are not simply engine parts for a changing economy.  If we insist too much that the goal of parenting and teaching is to produce  competent adults, the implication is that children are incompetent. We devalue  their skills and competencies as they are now with a future &lsquo;productivity&rsquo; goal  in mind. And we devalue the experience of childhood itself, falling into the  language of investment, future productivity and preparation for adulthood  rather than meeting children&rsquo;s needs as they are in the present. </p>
<p>That does not mean, however,  that we can shirk &lsquo;preparation&rsquo; as a goal; the future they face is different  and education must always lead them towards the skills they will need to be  capable citizens able to adjust to rapid change and serve the economic and  social purposes of society &ndash; it would be na&iuml;ve to think otherwise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just in education  that confusion reigns. There is also much </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>policy confusion about &lsquo;servicing&rsquo; families and  children</em></strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>We have a vast complex of &nbsp;separate, categorical &lsquo;services&rsquo; delivered  top-down to children and families rather than a coordinated attempt to resource  families and communities so that every child has access to the resources  necessary for full development of their learning potential. </p>
<p>We focus on changing faulty  or unsafe parenting behavior rather than teaching parents about childhood development  and creating a context in which doing better as a parent is easier. A  child-friendly community should be the goal, not just kind and helpful, or even  &lsquo;pushy&rsquo;, parents.</p>
<p>We pour millions of dollars  into one-on-one professional interventions and unevaluated &lsquo;child protection&rsquo;  services when we know it&rsquo;s impossible to have enough dollars to cover every  problem. Even the language of prevention diverts us from the real aim of  providing the best possible conditions for positive child development. </p>
<p><strong>Why such mixed messages?</strong></p>
<p>We are confused because the  place of children in society has shifted under our feet. That shift is not  simply a shift in values, it is driven by demographic, economic and social  changes. We need to rethink the structures and processes we use in dealing with  children if we are to effect real change.</p>
<p>Remember when Maggie Thatcher  asserted there was no such thing as society? Unfortunately the claim stuck and  we have been assailed by the repeated mantra of individual responsibility, freedom  of choice, the rights of the individual, the so-called free market and the  central goal of achieving personal happiness. And it&rsquo;s not just the corporate  or financial world that pushes this ethos; it has permeated our discussion of  ethics, social policy, education and family life. Psychology has triumphed over  sociology and most people have no idea of the structural limits to their own  freedom. If you fail, you have to blame yourself. </p>
<p>We have effectively  privatized the family and the task of parenting, despite the fact that modern  society out-sources many of the tasks of raising children. The sociology of  childhood has been lost, a trend which de-contextualises and de-politicises the  process and makes the privatized family the cause of failure instead of a  community which should share responsibility for the raising of future  generations. </p>
<p>Demographically, parents and  children are a shrinking minority in the developed world and they feel under  attack. Parents are in general older, have chosen to have fewer children, value  them highly and lavish them with every possible advantage, desperately trying to  be the ideal friendly parent raising perfect children on their own. </p>
<p>The dividing lines between  parent and adult have become blurred and there is a lack of confidence in being  a good parent. As a result (helped along by the new media) the family itself  becomes atomized, no longer a unit of shared responsibilities within the  context of wider community values. </p>
<p>This privatized family world  is circumscribed by two other forces affecting our values. </p>
<p>First, the world of economic  rationalism with its values of commercial greed and consumerism puts company  profits and the individual first rather than communal belonging and well-being.  Self-gratification and sleaze dominate advertising. Commercial television  discovered children were a vast new market and it didn&rsquo;t take long for public  broadcasters like the ABC to become as commercial as their competitors. Happiness  seems to be defined by what you own, not what you do. Children are now segmented  into babies, toddlers, pre-teens, tweens and teenagers, all primed to buy food,  toys, clothing and goods targeted carefully at them. Their parents are confused  about what is quality children&rsquo;s television, whether computer games are  dangerous and whether they can do anything about it all anyway. And teachers  lag behind their pupils in understanding the power and value of the new media  at their disposal.</p>
<p>Second, such media-driven  values set norms of behavior for a growing group of young adults living a life  of self-exploration and excitement that makes them indifferent, even hostile,  to the needs of children and their parents but makes them a model for the life  to which younger children aspire. </p>
<p>This group of Solos does not  identify with the mantra &lsquo;Children are our future&rsquo; and often resent what they  see as the favoritism of family-friendly workplace programs or family-oriented  tax breaks. For them the present is what matters and gloomy predictions of  environmental or economic catastrophe simply confirm their view that children  have no future anyway, so enjoy life while you can. </p>
<p>Children are thus sexualized  earlier, ape the clothing and manners of the Solos, and resent being held back  by parents fearful for their wellbeing. Grown-ups are, in turn, frightened by  this new breed and moral panics about drinking, drugs and sex produce knee-jerk  policy responses. </p>
<p>The key to ensuring the  wellbeing of all children is to surround families from every side, show them  how to nurture the best in children as partners in the learning process and  ensure each community has the resources necessary to produce the best outcomes  for all children. </p>
<p>The problem is, neither our  schools nor our service systems are aimed at providing those conditions, or at  reducing inequality, just at patching up the damage caused by it. </p>
<p>Part of the solution is more  equitable incomes. But it will also require policies that foster people&rsquo;s  &lsquo;capabilities to live meaningful lives&rsquo;, no matter what their family origins. That  means universal provision of parental leave, quality child care, quality  children&rsquo;s media programs, the best schools we can provide and, of course,  access to quality health and parent support services. Given that from birth to  age five, 85% of the brain&rsquo;s core is shaped, the conditions for healthy  development have to be in place.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>So what can be done to change the way children are valued? </strong></p>
<p>First, we need to change the  way we think about children. They are not just a private, family matter. What  happens to them in early childhood, at school, in the community, how they are  affected by the workplace, the media, the society at large is of vital  importance to everyone, not only their parents.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong><em>We need a new archetype of childhood</em></strong>.&nbsp; It has to be  along the lines of children as a new but special minority, as real people, with  real brains, real emotions, real human needs that should be given room for  expression; of young people as competent, powerful, determined, even nasty and  in need of firm guidelines for conduct as citizens of the world. </p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s children are not  innocents, not passive victims in need of protection. The majority of them are  active, aware, sophisticated learners often ahead of their parents and  teachers, exposed to much that was previously seen as adult knowledge, and they  are much more capable than many give them credit for. We have to stop talking  down to them, both in language and expectations. </p>
<p>Perhaps we should drop the  myth of innocence and teach children resilience, because the world they face  will demand it. We should allow them to be the decision-makers they are capable  of being in their own right. As my 5 year old grandson put it, after I&rsquo;d been  busily explaining some topic to him, &ldquo;Yes, Don, I know that. You&rsquo;re not the  only one that knows something.&rdquo; Moreover, if children have rights, then they  have responsibilities too, just as have adults. But talk of children&rsquo;s rights  is seen as another threat to adult power.</p>
<p>Second, we need a new  partnership, <strong><em>community-based model of childhood</em></strong>. It may sound cute to talk  about developing a &lsquo;child-friendly&rsquo; community, but the reverse is what we have  at present &ndash; an unfriendly one. Urban planning is capable of designing much  better housing estates: the return of the backyard or strip park, or small  vacant lot playgrounds in local neighborhoods could be mandated; we need  car-free streets, shady trees, linked walking paths and safe public transport. </p>
<p>Learning of course takes  place from the moment of birth and is affected by every element of the child&rsquo;s  environment. So we need to stop the top-down delivery of services and create  what I call &lsquo;Children&rsquo;s Resource Zones&rsquo;, neighborhood-sensitive areas where  every facility, every service, every effort is focused on drawing children and  parents into the learning and development process. </p>
<p>If you doubt such a model  could work, read about Geoffrey Canada&rsquo;s Harlem Children&rsquo;s Zone, recently  evaluated in a five-year study by Harvard University. Recognizing the new brain  research on the importance of early childhood, this Zone did away with  piecemeal reform efforts and linked in a coordinated way parenting classes,  pre-kindergarten classes of high quality, special tutoring, dance and sport  classes, food co-ops, social services, and help with housing and health. </p>
<p>The aim was not just to  &lsquo;prevent&rsquo; problems, but to transform the lives of the next generation. This  combination of community transformation, high-quality teaching and parental  support has raised children&rsquo;s achievement levels and closed the racial gap in  performance by transforming the way parents see their children&rsquo;s life chances.  The Children&rsquo;s Zone approach starts where it matters most &ndash; with the plasticity  of babies&rsquo; brains - and is trying to recreate, in homes and in the community,  what prosperous children already get &ndash; sustained care and concern over a  lifetime.</p>
<p>Unlike other piecemeal  measures like Headstart or SureStart, the Children&rsquo;s Zone starts with, but does  not stop at early childhood after a couple of years&rsquo; effort; it provides  continuity through the education system, sustaining the family involvement and  resourcing approach. </p>
<p>For me, that means our schools  should be community centres, the core of resourcing families in the cause of  better child development and learning. Schools would become &lsquo;Family Learning  Centres&rsquo;, or what the Victorian Catholic Education Office calls &lsquo;Schools as  Core Social Centres&rsquo;, not just places where children go for a few hours a day  and where learning is defined as what the teachers do with them. George Otero  of the New Mexico-based Centre for Relational Learning argues for a complete change  in the relationship between teacher and learner, and Professor John  West-Burnham of Manchester University&rsquo;s Centre for Educational Leadership  insists leadership must shift from a top-down approach to one that engages  people at every level of decision-making, including children.</p>
<p>Every school should be a  source of information and learning for children and their parents; even what we  now call adult education could be more closely linked with the schools and the  needs of local families.</p>
<p>If the schools were to become  Family Learning Centres, the full range of family support services and  resources would be centred round them. Indeed, we must replace the mania of  &lsquo;servicing&rsquo; families with the concept of &lsquo;resourcing&rsquo; them so they can draw on  a range of information, physical resources and specialist services as they  require them, preferably integrated within neighborhood hubs and &lsquo;Children&rsquo;s Resource  Zones&rsquo; focused on networks of schools and linked services rather than narrowly  targeted, run by separate arms of government and private agencies which never  talk to one another. </p>
<p>In the State of Victoria, we  have moved some way towards this model of integration. Early childhood has been  integrated into the education system, schools are becoming hubs for family and  children&rsquo;s services, with co-location and encouragement of inter-service  cooperation. The annual report on The State of Victoria&rsquo;s Children enables  better planning at the local level, with child outcomes data that can be  matched to resources, services and other local initiatives. Every local  government is required to draw up a Municipal Early Years Plan and soon will be  involved in developing Vulnerable Youth Action Plans aimed at involving young  people directly in pinpointing local issues and being active participants in  how to respond. </p>
<p>But above all, they need positive, meaningful  relationships with others, a stake in what they do with others rather than a  passive role in being &lsquo;treated&rsquo;, &lsquo;serviced&rsquo; or &lsquo;protected&rsquo; from harm. Our  language must become positive, not simply preventative, and change must come  from within the community, not top-down from those who think they know best.</p>
<p>Fortunately, both state and  federal governments are moving towards a whole-of-government approach to  educating and caring for children and families. Children&rsquo;s hubs, integration of  services around schools, the UNICEF-inspired Child-Friendly City movement, the  constant reminders from Richard Eckersley, the Australia Institute and others  that wellbeing and happiness do not stem from money alone, and the current  attempts to have Australia emulate the Canadian Index of Wellbeing, all point  in a more positive direction. </p>
<p>My fear is that the power of  the consumer market, plus the increasingly minority status of children and  parents, will overwhelm initiatives such as the Australian National Development  Index unless there is a clearer political stance on the value of childhood. </p>
<p>That is why policies about  media and communication must be updated. We need updated standards for quality  children&rsquo;s television, computer games and new media programs and communication  policy should be seen as integral to the education revolution, not as separate  from it. The ABC and ACMA must be made accountable to our national curriculum  framework so the media serve the true needs of today&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>Those working for children  have to come together with agreed values, within a coherent, co-ordinated  framework, not in an ineffective, fragmented way as at present. Above all, a  more active, political philosophy is needed, one which asserts that every child  has the capacity and the right to learn to the optimum of their ability.</p>
<p>A whole-of-government  children&rsquo;s policy is needed, not piecemeal actions by separate departments.  Child policy as an afterthought is no longer acceptable. </p>
<p>A whole New Deal is needed  for our children.</p>

<p>What if we said:</p>
<p>Kids don&rsquo;t need protecting,  they need exposure to the realities of the world and education in how to cope  with those realities.</p>
<p>Kids don&rsquo;t need just love and  nurturing, they need guidance and limit-setting.</p>
<p>Kids don&rsquo;t need time to just  be themselves, they need experiences that teach them who and what they might  become.</p>
<p>Kids don&rsquo;t need praise for  being &lsquo;smart&rsquo;, they need encouragement to further effort and how to achieve  more.</p>
<p>Nor do kids need  &lsquo;self-esteem&rsquo;, they need a sense of competence based on actual achievement.</p>
<p>Kids don&rsquo;t need just literacy  and numeracy, they need the skills required to make the world an ecologically  sustainable place in which equality is the goal of every policy and program.</p>
<p>Kids need the chance to  develop every aspect of their potential intelligence to discover their unique  strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Kids don&rsquo;t need to be valued  simply in their own right, but valued as future citizens who will have to make  tricky decisions affecting everyone.</p>
