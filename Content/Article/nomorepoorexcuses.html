treasurer Joe Hockey has called for an end to the ''culture of entitlement'' so
we live within our means. But in such a debate, the pejorative term ''welfare
benefits'' must go, replaced by real needs, equal rights and the common good.</span></p>

laments his lot as one of the ''undeserving poor'': &quot;Think what it means
to a man … he's up against middle-class morality all the time … 'You're
undeserving, so you can't have it' … I don't need less than a deserving man: I
need more …''</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:

right. Evidence suggests it is rich, well-educated, higher-status people who
feel entitled, not the poor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>A Berkeley
University study last year found that people in the upper echelons of society
were more likely to lie, cheat, take things meant for others, cut off other
road users and endorse unethical behaviour in others. Why? Because they feel
entitled. They are clever and have the money to cut corners and hire lawyers if
needed. These elite are less empathetic to others, less altruistic, more
individualistic and more greedy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Another study
by Professor Howard Gardner at Harvard University, on the meaning of ''good
work'', asked professionals how they juggled their ambition to succeed against
their desire to work responsibly and ethically. They claimed that values such
as fairness, scientific objectivity, truthful reporting and work-life balance
were important to them. But, in practice, many compromise these principles to
advance in their professions. They will, they say, change their behaviour once
established and successful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Gardner says
they know the difference between right and wrong but lack exemplars of ''good
work''. Post-modern relativism has undermined belief in the efficacy of
universal values such as truth, honesty, fairness and goodness. People have
been programmed to compete, distrust others and feel entitled because they are
brainier, more hard-working or more ambitious than others. They are ''the
deserving'', yet lack the morality on which a fair and equitable society must
be based.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Hockey is
right to suggest we must spend our tax money wisely, but he has a few blind
spots. The UN Declaration of Human Rights offers a reasonable framework.
Article 25 asserts: &quot;Everyone has the right to a standard of living
adequate for the health and well-being - and the right to security in the event
of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of
livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>The crucial
proviso (Article 24) is that these shall be provided within the country's
limits; they are not fixed entitlements but goals to be met insofar as
resources allow.</span></p>

12.75pt;vertical-align:baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";
color:black'>It's the law which makes rights into entitlements, and it's
government actions that produce a so-called ''entitlement mentality''. If the
retirement age is set at 55 instead of 65 or 70, if we neglect public education
and favour the elite or if we leave tax loopholes for the rich, there won't be
enough money for schools and hospitals. It is, as&nbsp;</span><i><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Most social
expenditure in Australia is, in any case, designed to make the economy more
efficient, not just as handouts to the disadvantaged. Parental leave is not a
handout, nor are disability benefits; they are aimed at keeping people
productive and active as citizens of a caring democracy. Childcare is not
welfare; it's a crucial grounding for adequate child development and a means of
capitalising on women's higher education in an economy short on skills. Good
food and health provision are not welfare; they are preventive insurance
against later costs of obesity, diabetes and extended, debilitating old age.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>The goal
should be to raise up the disadvantaged, to shore up the good society for all.
Without educated, healthy, well-housed and work-satisfied people, we are all
worse off. Inequality harms us all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Hockey and
others should be reminded too that social spending in Australia is nothing like
in profligate European regimes. Australia spends only 16 per cent of GDP on
so-called ''social entitlements''. Only 0.4 per cent of GDP goes to
unemployment benefits, the meanest level in the Western world. Just 2.4 per
cent goes to family benefits, aimed at ensuring women (now well educated and
productive) can have paid jobs as well as manage childcare. The biggest
payments are for health (5.7 per cent) and old age (4.3), both states of life
that are universal, not confined to the ''undeserving poor''. No political
party can afford to undermine such essential services in a decent society.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>We already
means-test payments more than any other OECD country, have compulsory
superannuation and are not yet living beyond our means.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>It is, in any
event, a travesty of policy to define the debate in terms of individual moral
failures. Tragedy and misfortune can strike a family at any time; the global
crisis throws people out of work, not their own laziness; floods and fires
destroy people's homes and livelihoods; a mother who stays at home to care for
children is doing work of value to us all and probably has before, and will
later contribute in the paid labour force as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;line-height:12.75pt;vertical-align:
baseline'><span style='font-family:"inherit","serif";color:black'>Social policy
should be based on a wider morality of ensuring equal opportunity for quality
education and training, room for choice and flexibility in the workplace,
respect for human rights and an expectation that every citizen will contribute
responsibly to the wider common good. We should not pit the ''deserving''
against the ''undeserving poor'', or we will all be poorer in every way.</span></p>
