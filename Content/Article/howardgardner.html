        <p><strong>Howard Gardner's 5 Minds for the Future:  Public Forum Melbourne June 6, 2007</strong></p>
    </div>
    <p><strong>By </strong><strong>Patricia   Edgar</strong><strong></strong></p>
    <p>I first became aware of the Howard Gardner's work nearly 20  years ago.&nbsp; I had spent 10 years teaching  in a university School  of Education, five years as Chair of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's  Children's Programme Committee, which set standards and approved children's  programs for a broadcast quota.&nbsp; That was  a challenging task. Then I found myself with another one, setting up the  Australian Children's Television Foundation where I had the task of turning  theory into practice and producing the programs I had claimed should present  the best of what children could expect to see on television. Some years into  that role, I decided I wanted to try to produce a ground breaking early  childhood program drawing on the latest knowledge about child development and  employing the best talent in Australia,  to devise an entertaining, educational and creative experience for  children.&nbsp; I had a strong belief in the  potential of television for educational purposes.</p>
    <p>It was then I read Howard Gardner's<em> Frames</em> <em>of Mind: The theory  of multiple intelligences</em>.&nbsp; It was an  epiphany; one of those life defining moments  when suddenly there is clarity. It made complete sense to me and this theory  would underscore <em>Lift Off</em> the early  childhood program I was devising.&nbsp; And so  I travelled to Harvard University to meet Howard Gardner. Then as now - in Howard's latest book, <em>Five Minds for the Future </em>- I  encountered a well reasoned and compelling set of propositions which, if we  could apply them in our education system, I have no doubt we would live in a  better and safer world, and a society that would stand a much better chance,  than we do now, for surviving into the future. In Howard's final paragraph he  says, &ldquo;Perhaps members of the human species will not be prescient enough to  survive, or perhaps it will take more immediate threats to our survival before  we make common cause with our fellow human beings.&nbsp; In any event the survival and thriving of our  species will depend on our nurturing of potentials that are distinctly human.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Much of my career has been involved with the application of  ideas and I want to briefly describe an experience - with which Howard is  familiar- that leads me to a question for Howard.</p>
    <p>When I developed <em>Lift  Off</em>, I gathered together more than 100 experts from differing fields with  an interest in children.&nbsp; There were  mathematicians, philosophers, scientists, musicians, writers, illustrators,  poets, psychologists, sociologists, environmentalists, puppeteers, actors -  every field imaginable and every form of intelligence was represented - and over three workshops we devised a curriculum and characters for the series <em>Liftoff. </em>&nbsp;&nbsp;The project blossomed as individuals with  different perspectives, knowledge and experience mixed ideas. . There were  clashes and conflicts but the obstructionists were weeded out very much in the  way Howard describes should be done in <em>Five  Minds for the Future</em>.</p>
    <p>Over three workshops we devised a program that became an  extraordinary success with its audience, with the educators and collaborators  involved, and with the critics.&nbsp; <em>Lift Off</em> was endorsed by all State  Directors of Curriculum. The ACTF had outreach activities organized with  parents and teachers and the Curriculum Corporation developed teaching  materials. $17 million was invested.&nbsp; It  took 4 years and it seemed we had got things right. The program would evolve  and we were well on the way to achieving a national education program involving  parents, schools and television; an experiment in television for children  unlike any in the world.&nbsp; But something  intervened. The market spoke.</p>
    <p>The ABC - our public broadcaster - cancelled <em>Lift Off</em>&nbsp;  so it could invest in <em>Bananas in  Pyjamas</em> - a simple, banal project - useless for educational purposes , but  a program they owned fully, that could be accompanied by&nbsp; a suite of merchandise. They continued with <em>Play-school</em>, a program which had run its  course in the UK  and Canada  because of its old- fashioned and outdated educational approach. Now what do we  have?<em> Play-school</em> has celebrated 50  years on air and the media have touted that as an achievement and Australia  has two iconic bananas. Lift Off an extraordinary resource for young children  languishes on the shelf unseen except by a privileged few including my four  grand children. Australian television does no more than but divert and  entertain our early childhood population, in their critical formative years.</p>
    <p>I still believe in the potential of the media to contribute  powerfully to the education of young minds. But we have allowed the media to  abdicate any responsibility for the type of education Howard Gardner is calling  for. Instead we allow them to influence, lifestyle, fashion, health and  consumption generally. Television for children world wide has become a negative  force. Targeting children as consumers is contributing to obesity and their  sexualisation at a young age. And we waste their brain power, which is surging  in those early years, as we steal their time to deliver to them programs of  inconsequence with a commercial purpose.</p>
    <p>Howard writes in <em>Five  Minds for the Future,&rdquo; </em>Society does not always support the propagation of such positive role models. It is difficult to be a disciplined thinker when  television quiz shows lavishly reward disparate factual knowledge.&nbsp; It is difficult to be respectful toward  others when an argument mentality characterizes politics and the mass media and  when bald-faced intimidators morph into cultural heroes.&nbsp; It is difficult to behave ethically when so  many rewards - monetary and renown - are showered on those who spurn ethics,  but have not, or at&nbsp; least have not yet,  been held accountable by the broader society. Were our media and our leaders to  honour the five kinds of minds foregrounded here, and to ostracize those who  violate these virtues, the job of the educators and supervisors would be  incalculably easier&rdquo; </p>
    <p>My question to Howard Gardner  is: how do we achieve the change in attitudes necessary to reform our education system?</p>
    <p>He says and I agree &ldquo;Schools alone cannot do the job. The  burden of education must be shared by parents, neighbours, the traditional and  digital media, the church and other communal institutions.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Howard says he does &ldquo;not believe for a minute that markets  will inevitably yield benign or moral outcomes.&nbsp;  They can be cruel and, anyway, are fundamentally amoral.&nbsp; And he draws on the words of Jonathan Sacks  Chief Rabbi in Britain.<br />
        &ldquo;When everything that matters can be bought and sold, when  commitments can be broken because they are no longer to our advantage, when  shopping becomes salvation and advertising slogans become our litany, when our  worth is measured by how much we earn and spend, then the market is destroying  the very virtues on which in the long run it depends.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>In his book Howard has moved from describing the typical  operations of the mind to offering views about how we should use our minds.</p>
    <p>I have tried to work with the education system to change  media for children. Anything I have achieved is but a drop in an ocean. I now  think that we need an integrated child policy that brings together education,  health and communication policy for children. Education policy does not deal  with the media. I think it must, for the negative and powerful influence of the  media in a free market economy is too overpowering for parents and educators to  contend with in the development of Howard Gardner's <em>Five Minds of the Future?</em></p>
    <p>What is the next step?</p>
    <p><strong>Gardner and Good Work - Don Edgar's  Response to 5 Minds for the Future</strong><br />
    <strong>Forum, 7 July, 2007</strong></p>
    <p>Howard's opening premise - that in  this interconnected age, it is not possible for parts of the world to thrive  while others remain desperately poor and frustrated - is a challenge to all of  us who work either in government or in business. Because many governments and  many corporations round the world continue to ignore Benjamin Franklin's words  (quoted by Gardner on p. 2 of his  book '<em>Five Minds for the Future'</em>):  &ldquo;We must indeed all hang together, or, most assuredly, we shall all hang  separately.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Over the last several years, I have  been working with business organizations and with government departments and  community service organizations in an attempt to get them to see those  connections - in Howard's terms, to synthesise the lessons learned from the  not-so-disciplined areas of economics, family research, social welfare,  community-building, good governance and human resource management.</p>
    <p>I have two related issues I'd like  Howard to address, if he would:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>One concerns the ethics of work-family relations</li>
        <li>The other concerns a lack of respect between  government policy-makers and administrators and the community they are there to  serve </li>
        <li>The element common to them both is what I see as  an inability on the part of many so-called experts (those who have mastered a  discipline such as management, or social work, or economics) to see the links -  to synthesise - that would improve both efficiency and the common good.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let me explain very briefly.</p>
    <p>Howard talks about good work as  being excellent in quality, being engaging and meaningful, and being  responsible in that it takes into account its implications for the wider  community. As well, he suggests that the ethical mind is not restricted to the  workplace - it involves everyone in working towards the realization of the  virtuous community.</p>
    <p>It seems to me then, that the way a  workplace or business treats its workers and their family/community obligations  lies at the heart of what Howard calls 'good work'. If a worker is prevented  from fulfilling his or her family and wider community responsibilities because  of unsympathetic work practices, then the whole social fabric is damaged. </p>
    <p>I have long argued that family work  is work of meaning and value, yet it is not valued (not even recognized) by  many corporate leaders and business managers. Their attitude is that having a  family to care for is an individual choice and a private obligation, that their  only duty is to run the business for profit - the shareholders' profit that is  - and employee needs, such as flexible start and finish times, parental leave,  time off to meet the often pressing and urgent demands of children or ageing  parents, are not their concern. </p>
    <p>True, the good employer does take  note, and we have some good corporate models, but after three decades working  in the area of work-family balance, I can tell you it's a grudging acceptance,  with the words flexibility and choice taking on a new meaning more suited to  business efficiency than good work-family practice. </p>
    <p>This is true in spite of sound  research showing the economic cost-benefits of a family-friendly workplace:  attracting the best recruits, retaining them and avoiding the costs of  retraining new employees, being the employer of choice, not to mention the  gains from lower absenteeism, fewer accidents, better morale and productivity,  etc.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>They are experts in their field,  but fail to see the links into other aspects of community life that affect  their business.</p>
    <p>There seems little concern for the  wider community good that comes from encouraging employees to better fulfil  their family and citizen obligations. Instead, we have corporate philanthropy  defined narrowly as giving to good causes, more often show than substance, when  better results might be had by businesses working more closely with family  support services and local schools to build a truly family-friendly,  child-friendly community. This is what I have called 'The New Links Workplace',  a creative re-alignment of workplace, family and community interests.&nbsp; But very few businesses bother.</p>
    <p>This brings me to my second  example, that of government-community relations. In my book <em>The Patchwork Nation</em>, I argued against  one-size-fits-all, top-down delivery of government services to the diverse  patchwork of communities and regions that make up this nation. Howard cites the  Italian community of Reggio Emilia as a good example of not just quality early  childhood services, but of a place where every aspect of community affairs is  cognizant of its impact on the quality of life of its children and families as  a whole. It's a message policy-makers should take note of.</p>
    <p>The research is clear on this -  it's not just the quality of individual pre-school programs, or separate school  curricula, or of the local health services that matters. It is the ways in  which they work together, the links made across related professional spheres;  plus the degree to which they engage with, actually involve and encourage the  participation of parents and citizens in the decision-making process, that  correlates with good child outcomes, better school readiness, enhanced family  welfare in general. </p>
    <p>Being engaged, surrounded by  well-integrated support systems, is far more effective (and cost-efficient)  than merely providing top-down services to needy clients. But that message does  not somehow get through. And government services typically work in isolation  from the workplaces which directly affect family life.</p>
    <p>Members of this audience will have  heard endless talk on the part of the Victorian Government about community-building,  about a whole-of-government approach, about participatory decision-making. But  I can tell you, the Emperor wears no clothes. And why? </p>
    <p>My guess is that what Howard  Gardner calls the disciplined mind, the experts who manage our service systems,  are not at all convinced that they should respect (or even bother listening to)  that endlessly messy and recalcitrant lot we call the citizens (in their terms,  the clients of the service system). </p>
    <p>I was a member of the Premier's  Children's Advisory Committee which recommended a new, community-based approach  to early childhood services. The Premier accepted our recommendations in toto.  Yet, two plus years later, the key recommendation to set up Children's Resource  Zones, develop community family forums and build integrated children's centres  - to be more creative in the way community support services are developed and  run - looks a distant dream. We have some integrated children's centres, some  community involvement, but overall the system looks the same. Other more  professional problems get in the way - the political dangers of child  protection, the quirks of personal ministerial policy interests, and (in my  view) the inertia of a professionalized system that thinks it knows best. </p>
    <p>Too much money is still spent on  services that are not preventative, not strength-building, merely stop-gap  ambulances at the bottom of the cliff. And community concerns, family  engagement in deciding how their diverse needs might best be met, continue to  be ignored.</p>
    <p>So, Howard, how would you suggest  we tackle both the weighty ballast of professional expertise and its lack of  respect for the views of ordinary citizens, and their inability to synthesise  beyond their own field of knowledge, to see the links between economics, social  welfare, community-building, between health, education, welfare and work, in  order to build a truly ethical, mutually respectful society and community?</p>
