    <b>The digital revolution has increased opportunities for advertisers to target children with junk-food promotions.</b>
    <br />
    Patricia Edgar, June 11, 2009
    </p>
    <p><b>B</b>Y ANY measure, self-regulation of junk-food advertising by the
    industry in the public interest has been a monumental failure. Shrek promotes the
    Belly Bulge Combo (M&amp;Ms, Coke and popcorn) and kids expand to match him.</p>

    <p>The health industry and children's lobbyists, now armed with evidence and
    reports, are calling for reform of the junk-food industries after more than a
    decade of inaction by governments. But the battle is on a much broader front
    than anticipated.</p>

    <p>The food and beverage industries have followed children from television into
    a technological haven of social networks, instant messaging, interactive games,
    mobile phones and virtual three-dimensional environments, which teenagers have
    colonised and made their own.</p>

    <p>Exciting new opportunities for the advertising industry lie in this digital
    marketplace. Marketers are observing, monitoring and analysing teenagers' media
    use to target their needs and weaknesses as never before. The food and beverage
    companies — Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Kraft, Burger King, Pepsi, KFC — are major
    players in this process.</p>

    <p>The next edition of <i>Journal of Adolescent Health</i> in the US reports an
    article by Kathryn Montgomery and Jeff Chester, &quot;Interactive Food and
    Beverage Marketing: Targeting adolescents in the Digital Age&quot;, which draws
    together findings from 180 studies and reports, all conducted in recent years,
    to describe the digital marketing strategies being used to track
    &quot;cyber-teens&quot; — 13-17-year-olds. It's a wake-up call.</p>

    <p>Teenagers are digital natives and while they are drawn to these new
    technologies they are also shaping their use for the future. Initiatives being
    tested in cyberspace are combining research from a broad range of disciplines
    including semantics, artificial intelligence, auction theory, social network
    and behavioural analysis, data mining and statistical modelling.</p>

    <p>New mobile marketing strategies take advantage of young people's
    multi-tasking and constant connectivity through technology to target teenagers
    directly with electronic pitches, based on their personal profiles, which they
    will have supplied.</p>

    <p>Young people have become used to creating individual play-lists on an MP3
    player, a profile on a social networking site, or designing an avatar to
    represent them in a virtual world. They share personal information with their
    cyber friends thus creating a resource advertisers could never have dreamed of</p>

    <p>20 years ago. MySpace already can offer its advertising clients a detailed
    profile of each user (and their friends). Web 2 platforms are a gift to
    marketers as online monitoring can identify the most influential person in a
    social network and even their psychological state of mind.</p>

    <p>Food companies are collaborating with neuroscientists and the US Advertising
    Research Foundation to understand the brain's role in triggering emotions,
    thoughts and actions and how specific patterns of brain activation predict
    purchasing. There are already 90 private neuromarketing research firms in the
    US using methods such as eye-tracking, galvanic skin response, and
    electroencephalography to design advertising capable of fostering emotional and
    unconscious choices rather than reasoned thoughtful decisions.</p>

    <p>It is likely such techniques will be highly effective for marketing within
    interactive games, which are receiving special attention as the fastest growing
    form of entertainment. Ads are being incorporated into game storylines and the
    game programmed to respond to a player's actions in real time, changing, adding
    or updating messages to tailor their appeal to that particular individual.
    Coca-Cola has established a presence in Second Life where Coke vending machines
    can be seen dotting the landscape of the highly popular three-dimensional
    virtual world.</p>

    <p>User-generated content too is one of the fastest-growing forms of content on
    the internet, offering unique opportunities for advertisers. More than half of
    all online teens are creating content for the web. Marketing strategies are
    being designed to tap into the pool of young creative talent eager to offer
    their services for free to produce commercial spots for food companies
    sponsoring contests.</p>

    <p>Entrants submit their videos on YouTube, ensuring they will be seen by
    thousands of viewers whether or not they win and the content produced, apart
    from directly marketing a product, yields insight into consumer attitudes and
    feelings. Google has introduced an algorithm that can predict which videos are
    about to go viral. The system then invites advertisers to target their ads to
    those videos poised to become popular on YouTube.</p>

    <p>While still a fairly modest percentage of the overall advertising
    expenditures of food companies, online marketing becomes highly effective and
    efficient targeted marketing, which is inexpensive to implement.</p>

    <p>In the '70s, research concluded that children younger than seven or eight
    lacked the cognitive ability to understand advertising's persuasive intent and
    could be enticed by people they admired — even cartoon characters — to pester
    their parents to buy. Lobbyists are still arguing for a ban on celebrity
    endorsements to be enforced 30 years on (<i>The Age</i>, 9/6). That visible
    problem is the tip of the iceberg now.</p>

    <p>The view that adolescents can resist advertising more effectively than
    younger children is being challenged by research showing the brain does not
    fully mature until late adolescence. As children reach puberty, hormonal
    changes can lead to impulsive behaviour, negative mood swings, use of addictive
    products and engagement in thrill-seeking experiences. In light of the
    sophistication of marketing strategies, teenage users could be as vulnerable as
    their younger siblings.</p>

    <p>What a tragedy it is that all this research and expenditure is applied to
    selling products that put children at risk, while education and schools are
    light years behind the commercial world in applying science and new forms of
    technology to children's learning.</p>
