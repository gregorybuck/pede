<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>As
our parliamentary players have switched into vaudeville and politicians are
vying to take centre stage, grab attention and play the fool, I am reminded
strongly of a program I produced 20 years ago called <i>Lift-Off </i>which
included a puppet segment called the <i>Wakadoo Caf&#233;</i>. It was a realm where
human feelings and relationships, in all their complexity, were explored
through the Boss, Lonely, Nearly, Zelda, Cook, the Wolf and the Three Pigs,
with their foibles and anxieties. It was designed to teach three to
eight-year-olds about emotional intelligence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The
program was based upon the theory by eminent Harvard Professor Howard Gardner
who argued that intelligence was not a unitary concept concerned only with the
RRRs. He identified seven intelligences which should be developed in young
children if they were to grow into well rounded human beings. They included
inter-personal and intra-personal intelligence, that is the understanding of
our relationships with others and our understanding of ourselves. These are
intelligences that seem to be singularly lacking in many of our politicians.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>To
teach these concepts to young audiences we settled on puppets who worked in the
Wakadoo Caf&#233; and sang about their concerns. They each represented a particular
personality trait and interacted with one another from that perspective.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Bob
Ellis was the main writer who also composed the lyrics to the music of Chris
Neal. Terry Denton drew the characters and the now famous sculptor Ron Mueck
created them as three dimensional puppets. The creative team was remarkably
prescient in designing for the Wakadoo Caf&#233; the characters who seem to inhabit
Parliament house today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Boss,
who ran the caf&#233;, is a dead ringer for Julia Gillard; she's got the shape and
is dressed like the PM, even down to the large beads around her neck. She was
definitely in charge.</span></p>
