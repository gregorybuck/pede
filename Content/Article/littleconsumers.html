    font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>E EAT too much, we drink too much and we
    spend more than we earn. Our lifestyle has brought the world economy to the
    brink of catastrophe, and the solution politicians offer is to go shopping.</span></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
    font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Eating disorders and body image concerns
    among boys and girls are common. Tiny, bright, young things, who should be out
    playing chasey together, are worrying about what they look like and whether
    they fit in with their peers. There is an increase in child mental health
    problems including depression. These trends are well documented.</span></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
    font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Did children's television have anything
    to do with this crisis? It seems it did. Our programs have been a major
    training ground in teaching kids to grow up fast and be acquisitive.</span></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
    font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Twenty years ago, good story ideas drove
    children's programming decisions. Kids were not considered a market, much less
    a profitable one. They were a special audience and programs such as the early <i>PlaySchool</i>,
    <i>Round the Twist</i> and <i>Lift Off</i> were provided to serve their needs
    as they entertained.</span></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
    font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>This changed with the advent of
    children's channels in the '90s and fierce competition between them for market
    share.</span></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
    font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>While Disney began marketing Mickey
    Mouse as far back as the 1920s, it was the success in the '80s of
    program-length commercials such as <i>He-Man and the Masters of the Universe</i>,
    <i>GI Joe: A Real American Hero</i>, <i>Care Bears</i> and <i>Strawberry
    Shortcake</i> that set light bulbs off in the minds of toy manufacturers and
    producers around the globe. They conceived the idea of tie-ins to link products
    promoting <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i>, <i>Transformers</i>, <i>Mighty
    Morphin Power Rangers</i> and <i>Action Man</i>. The industries involved boomed
    and children were seen as consumers from then on. It wasn't long before the
    public broadcasters wanted their slice of the cake and, in the '90s, along came
    <i>Barney</i> in the US, <i>Teletubbies</i> in the UK and <i>Bananas in Pyjamas</i>
    in Australia.</span></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
    font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>It was a revelation to public
    broadcasters to discover there was money to be made from programs when accompanied
    by a suite of merchandise. Smart rhetoric to call the toys and goods
    &quot;educational&quot; was devised and consciences were salved. Branding was
    the new mantra as public broadcasting's values became as commercial as their
    competitors. The measure of success was market share.</span></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
    font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Grasping the potential, marketers
    decided they could get more bang for their bucks by expanding the preschool and
    children's market to four categories, including baby and tween television.</span></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
    font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>We now know the first few years of life
    are a critical period for brain development and learning. So it stands to
    reason that preschool television programs should be developed with purpose from
    a well-informed research base. Instead, preschoolers, including babies, have
    led a marketing bonanza for the toy, food and character merchandising
    industries at the expense of education and development.</span></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
    font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Research has demonstrated that
    materialism in children is positively associated with shopping and spending,
    and negatively associated with school performance. By the age of 10, 78 per
    cent of children say they enjoy shopping; they are well on the way to being
    successful consumers.</span></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
    font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>For tweens, eight to 12-year-olds, a new
    lifestyle was created; miniature bras, sexy thongs, cool accessories, beauty
    products and parties with mocktails became the norm. In programming, plots,
    casting, art and costume departments have been influenced by this new tween
    style and look.</span></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
    font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>If you want to sell a program now, you
    think about the marketing potential before you think about the needs of
    children. The irony is that the more you target and segment the market, the
    smaller it becomes and the programs for each market lose their complexity,
    texture and appeal.</span></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
    font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Once kids assume control of the remote,
    they don't want this soulless world; they want to be participants in life — and
    they can find out about life, as never before, on the internet and through
    their mobile world. They are still watching television but it's <i>The Simpsons</i>,
    <i>Rove</i>, <i>Spicks and Specks</i> and <i>The Biggest Loser</i>, the soaps,
    reality and talent shows that attract them over the programs now made in their
    name.</span></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
    font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>But far more appealing to tweens and
    teens than television is their new-found, more private and personal world on
    social network sites. They love the challenge of games. They want to use
    technology to talk to one another and show their own stories in a world they
    live in and seek to master.</span></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
    font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Kids are different today. They are
    knowing and demanding. So we need imaginative new thinking to recapture this
    audience with programming experiences they want. It's likely we will be hoist
    on our own petard. It's a well-guarded secret that child audiences are
    diminishing and children's channels are not doing so well. As this trend
    continues, marketers will dump kids' television as quickly as they colonised it
    and the children's production business as we have known it will disappear.</span></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
    font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>As program makers, are we capable of
    changing direction? Or will we continue to make compromises until the audience
    deserts us? Do we have any moral and social responsibility to try harder to
    change the nature of commercial programming? Is it possible kids will be the
    ones who transform media in their name as they forsake television, spawn their
    own interactive programs and leave us wondering what has happened?</span></p>
