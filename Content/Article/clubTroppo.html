            Many
            readers will have heard of Patricia Edgar who was a giant force
            in&nbsp;Australian cultural life&nbsp;from the 1970s. She more than anyone else
            was responsible for lifting the tone of children's TV in&nbsp;Australia. In any
            event&nbsp;I was talking to her recently about the current woes of children's

            On May 6,
            2017, the Minister for Communications, Mitch Fifield announced 'a broad ranging
            and comprehensive review of Australian and children's content' within a broader
            media reform package aimed at assisting free-to-air networks to remain viable
            in the highly competitive digital era. At the same time, the House Standing
            Committee on Communications and the Arts is inquiring into the 'factors
            contributing to the growth and sustainability of the Australian film and
            television industry'. These enquiries have come about because of the impact of
            digital technology on the free-to-air networks and have triggered off a battle
            royal between the networks and the producers with both groups acting from
            positions of self interest.

            For forty
            years the networks have been opposed to children's television quotas.
            They've&nbsp;employed every tactic in the book to subvert successful
            programming. But for the first time they have a legitimate case as the child
            audience is now deserting scheduled television in droves for the Pied Piper of
            social media; the networks claim child audiences have gone down as low as 2000
            viewers for a program.

            The
            producers, who have enjoyed the most effectively regulated production system
            for children's programs anywhere in the world, are understandably, wanting to
            cling to the quotas and subsidies that have allowed some of them to establish
            profitable businesses. They want them expanded to include the ABC and pay
            television platforms. However they have shown few signs of adapting to the new
            technologies.

            The rhetoric on both sides of the argument is extravagant and

            In the
            1960's and early 70's Australian children watched American sit-coms for their
            entertainment as school and community groups called vigorously for Australian
            programs.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Children's Television Standards (CTS) were first
            mooted in 1976 in a report from the Australian Broadcasting Control Board
            (ABCB), the networks ridiculed the proposal. They claimed then they did not
            have the resources for such programming. They asserted they did not know what a
            children's program looked like, that Australian kids couldn't act and they
            would not watch such programs. They argued the high costs of technology in
            converting to colour in 1976 would consume all their revenue. But colour proved
            to be a bonanza.

            Fortune then favoured the networks as Prime Minister Whitlam was
            sacked and Malcolm Fraser became Prime Minister. The Federation of Commercial
            Television Stations (FACTS) persuaded Fraser to sack the recalcitrant ABCB and
            set up a new regulatory authority, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT),
            with a Chairman of their choosing. Bruce Gyngell a former Channel Seven and
            Nine Executive was appointed Chairman. Gyngell's first task was to chair
            the&nbsp;<i>Self Regulation for Broadcasters?</i>&nbsp;Inquiry and he came to
            the view the industry should accept the regulation of children's programs. The
            best laid plans went astray. Kerry Packer was furious and the two long term
            friends fell out for a time.

            The ABT
            set up the Children's Program Committee (CPC) to implement the Standards in
            1979, and the networks set out to undermine the process, first by withdrawing
            their representative from the Committee. Led by FACTS, which was dominated by
            Kerry Packer's Nine Network, the industry fought a vitriolic battle in the
            media condemning the ABT's proposals for C and P (pre-school) classified
            programs. Fifteen commercial television licensees challenged the validity of
            the ABT's power to classify programs, in the Federal Court. They lost, but
            pursued their argument in the High Court which held the ABT's Standards were
            invalid. Labor's Communication Minister, Michael Duffy then introduced an
            Amendment Bill affirming the ABT's powers. Finally the networks had no choice
            but to comply or risk losing their license. This entire process took eight
            years.

            For the
            following decade the system of subsidy and regulation worked, in part because,
            as the networks had not prepared for losing their case, they had to buy the
            programs eager producers had in the pipeline. The Australian Children's
            Television Foundation (ACTF) was established, and along with other children's
            program producers, who shared a passion for their audience, they came up with a
            range of quality Australian stories which attracted the child audience and
            spawned both a domestic and international industry.

            Australia
            had in place, a regulatory structure through the CTS and drama quota, subsidy
            through the FFC and state film bodies, an ACTF that demonstrated quality in
            children's programs and had drawn the attention of world broadcasters to
            Australian programs by winning awards. An industry concerned with quality had
            been created, despite network opposition, and Australian children were the
            beneficiaries.

            But in
            1995, with the best of intentions, the ABA made a strategic error. They doubled
            the quota and things began to unravel. It became simpler for the networks to
            fill their quotas with long-running series and animations which undermined the
            diversity of live-action programs. The bigger problem was that the Film Finance
            Corporation (FFC), the major source of funding for children's programs, was
            facing cut backs. In 1994 the FFC invested $ 20 million, 23% of its funding,
            into children's programs. By 1998 their investment had dropped to $9.3 million.
            This was when the drama quota doubled.

            Networks,
            aware of this problem, drove down license fees and squeezed producers. They put
            pressure on the FFC to approve cheaper programming and pressure on the ABA to
            classify such programs C, but such programs inevitably fell short on quality
            expectations.

            The problems were exposed by the ABA's evaluation of&nbsp;<i>
                20
                Years of C,
            </i>&nbsp;released in March 2000. This review demonstrated that,
            after a courageous beginning and a record demonstrating significant improvement
            in children's programming, the hard-won system was failing and children were
            once again missing out on the programs that had made a significant difference
            to their Australian cultural experience. But nothing was done to redress the
            problems.

            The number
            of active live-action producers declined. Longer-running series increased,
            program diversity declined and animations soared. The networks continued to
            meet their quotas as cheaply as possible and buried programs in their
            schedules, doing nothing to promote them in order to attract an audience The
            values on which the children's drama quota had been based - giving a window
            into children's lives from their perspective - were undermined.

            In this
            climate a number of producers realized there was money to be made out of the
            children's market through animations, merchandising and mediocre long running
            series that could be sold overseas to fill the voracious appetite of digital
            children's channels. Some producers effectively worked for overseas companies
            as production managers allowing them to access Australian funds while retaining
            creative control.

            The claim that has remained the production industry mantra today
            is that producers are still 'creating quality programs' in 'the best interests
            of children'. But given the extent of public investment the highlights are few.
            The most iconic Australian children's program, one I produced, is&nbsp;<i>
                Round
                the Twist&nbsp;
            </i>and it is still named to support the quotas. Such a program
            could not be made today - the budget could not be achieved and production
            partners would sanitize the content and destroy its appeal. The evidence also
            shows children have come to be seen, not as individuals in an audience, who are
            there to be informed and entertained, but as a market.

            Ironically Screen Australia's<i>&nbsp;Convergence Report</i>&nbsp;in
            2011 pointed out Australian children didn't want to watch the Australian
            programs being made for them then, they preferred to watch thirty-five year old
            American sit-coms such as&nbsp;<i>

            The latest report from ACMA on Children's television viewing and multi- screen
            behaviour, (August 2017) will give no comfort to those wanting to retain
            quotas. Children are not watching Australian produced children's television.
