or more particularly, old age - much thought. Her parents lived long lives and
had mercifully quick deaths, her mother at 89 and her father at 95.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;vertical-align:baseline'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";

ageing into sharp relief.</span></p>

color:black'>At a routine pap smear, she was told she would no longer be
notified that she was due for the biennial check (although she was still
welcome to have it); at a colonoscopy she had regularly because her father had
had bowel cancer, she was again told that she needn't worry about it any more,
as at 70 she was considered &quot;clear&quot;. Edgar had had breast cancer in
1998, but her specialist told her similar news: she needn't bother with any
more appointments.</span></p>

back',&quot; Edgar explains. &quot;So I said to my GP, 'what's going on?' He
said, 'A new cancer would take about eight years to develop and your age
expectancy kicks in around then.' &quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;vertical-align:baseline'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";

the expense to the medical system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;vertical-align:baseline'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>Add to this the general ''invisibility'' that older people - and
older women in particular - can feel, and the ways in which, Edgar believes,
they are routinely dismissed or patronised, and the conclusion she draws is
that something is seriously wrong with the way we think about, talk about and
manage ageing in Australia.</span></p>

color:black'>The result of her research and thinking is a new book,&nbsp;<i>In
Praise of Ageing</i>, which deftly mixes a sociological and economic study with
personal accounts of older Australians leading extraordinary lives and taking
their old age in their stride.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;vertical-align:baseline'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>To talk all of this through we have taken a corner table at
Huxtable, a funky restaurant on Smith Street, just up from the Australian
Children's Television Association, which Edgar headed until 2002, and not far
from the two houses - one for living, the other for working - she shares with
her husband, fellow sociologist and writer Don Edgar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='vertical-align:baseline'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'><img width=300 height=563
id="Picture 4" src="images/lunch_image004.jpg" alt="&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;vertical-align:baseline'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>For lunch, Edgar chooses the barramundi with mushroom duxelles,
pickled cauliflower and mustard sauce; I opt for the lamb with smoked eggplant,
farro and kale. Outside, the young and hip of Smith Street go about their
business; inside, we contemplate the nature of getting old.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;vertical-align:baseline'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>While some parts of the health system seem eager to move older
people on, Edgar argues, other parts are pathologising old age. As a
consequence, ageing is increasingly ''treated'' pharmacologically, for example
in the race to find an effective treatment for dementia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;vertical-align:baseline'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>And, she says, we must get better at talking about death, which
surely undergirds so much of our discomfort with old age and people. &quot;It's
really important to talk about death and it's important not to have these
[medical] interventions which keep people living for a very long time,
expensively.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;vertical-align:baseline'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>Not that ageing is all bad news. While Edgar was taken aback by
the extent to which older people are not taken seriously - not just by the
health system, but as vital cogs in the economic wheel - she simultaneously
came across older Australians, many in their 90s, who were ageing fabulously,
and wanted to tell that side of the story too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;vertical-align:baseline'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>At the heart of Edgar's thinking were some tricky questions: what
decides how well we age? Why do some people seem to retreat and wither, while
others blossom in their later years, embrace new experiences and thrive? She
concluded that while our genetic make-up might play a role in how well we age,
what mattered far more was our attitude to it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;vertical-align:baseline'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>&quot;Longevity is negotiable,&quot; she says. &quot;It's really
the way in which people face up to what's happened in their lives.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;vertical-align:baseline'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>She also looked at how older people are represented in popular
media and in entertainment, such as on television, and found some damaging and
dated stereotypes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;vertical-align:baseline'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>With Australians on average now living into their 80s, and a 100th
birthday nowhere near as remarkable as it used to be, why would people of 60 be
referred to as &quot;elderly&quot;, she wondered? Similarly, why are older
Australians so absent from television - except in the most minor
representations - when they are such heavy television viewers?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;vertical-align:baseline'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>&quot;I know from the research that if you don't see yourself on
television, then you think you're not very important,&quot; she says.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;vertical-align:baseline'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>Television is, of course, a young person's medium, and much of
that is driven by advertising. But Edgar thinks that will shift as the baby
boomer generation moves into old age.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;vertical-align:baseline'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>&quot;It's going to change because the baby boomers have got money
and there is a bit of commercial potential there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;vertical-align:baseline'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>In some ways, she says, the way we think about older Australians
needs to undergo the same shift that happened with adolescence in the
post-World War II years, when the idea of a bridging age between childhood and
adulthood really came into being.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;vertical-align:baseline'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>As to how to age well, Edgar says she learnt a great deal on this
from her nonagenarian friends, the most important of which was that those who
did best were the people who &quot;reinvented&quot; themselves, learnt new
skills and hobbies and kept their bodies and minds active.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;vertical-align:baseline'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>Edgar, 76, feels like a youngster alongside them, and has no sense
of old age looming. She is busy with grandchildren, various artistic and
cultural interests, and has already started working on her next book.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;vertical-align:baseline'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>&quot;No matter who you are, you cannot retire and do nothing.
You've got to have a project of some kind,&quot; she says. That may mean
deciding to stay in paid work longer (where prejudice against older workers
lingers), or pursuing an interest such as gardening, bowling or writing.
&quot;The people who are doing nothing, they're the ones who get
depressed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;vertical-align:baseline'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>Embracing old age as best we can and staying engaged with other
people are vital to us living as well as possible in our later years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;vertical-align:baseline'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'>&quot;In the end, old age will get everybody,&quot; Edgar says.
&quot;It's the way it's dealt with [that matters].&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:9.6pt;vertical-align:baseline'><span
