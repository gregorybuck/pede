always new, but Don and Patricia Edgar believe Australian children today are
entering an unprecedented moral and social landscape. Their book, <i>The New
Child, In search of smarter grown-ups</i>, describes what is emerging now and
gives some pointers to help children find their way.</span>

        <span lang="EN-US"
            style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'>The Edgars say
the book came about partly from observing their four grandchildren and
realising the world they inhabit is radically different from the one their two
daughters lived in when they were growing up in the 1960s.</span>

        <span lang="EN-US"
            style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'>They write:
&quot;In those days, being a good parent meant simply raising your children to
be decent people, to have the basic skills everyone needed to survive -
reading, writing, a bit of maths and enough nous to make a reasonable fist of
life. Today we've become more ambitious for our children: probably too
ambitious for their good and for our own peace of mind. Because we delay having
children, and then have only one or two, they are a very important part of
life. Since it's no longer an automatic assumption that children will come
along ... the emotional impact of having a child is greater. That makes the
child precious and guarantees (in most instances) a better quality of parental
attention to needs.&quot;</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='line-height: normal'>
        <span lang="EN-US"
            style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'>But there is a
downside: these children are living in a postmodern world, without agreed
values, in which family structures are more fragmented, in which market forces
dominate as never before and in which parents are busier. Once children knew
the other children in their street and spent their free time playing outside
with a tribe of neighbours and their own brothers and sisters. Now street play
is less common, families are smaller and children are more likely to be found
alone inside with a computer.</span>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='line-height: normal'>
        <span lang="EN-US"
            style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'>The Edgars bring
a lifetime to experience to their task. Patricia Edgar was the founder and
director of the Australian Children's Television Foundation and chairs the
World Summit Foundation on Media for Children, while Don Edgar was the founding
director of the Australian Institute of Family Studies and member of the
Victorian Children's Council, working to reform and better integrate children's
services. The book reflects their different but convergent interests, combining
personal anecdotes, sociological research and examining the role the new media
plays in children's lives.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='line-height: normal'>
        <span lang="EN-US"
            style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'>&quot;Life is a
bit lonely for many children today,&quot; they write. &quot;Parents send them a
mixed message: 'We love you, but there's no time to talk now.' A recent
international study found that young children who were accustomed to running
their own lives while parents worked were more likely to resist parental
disapproval of their behaviour as teenagers. It was a case of: Who are you? Why
do you think you have a right to tell me what to do? Where have you been all
the years I've been growing up?&quot;</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='line-height: normal'>
        <span lang="EN-US"
            style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'>In addition,
many parents are not only busy, but also confused, the Edgars say. It is not
unusual for new parents to have little experience with young children - despite
the recent spike in births, the national birth rate is still below replacement
levels and about a third of adults will never be parents. Where once new
parents may have sought practical advice from siblings or peers, they are now
more likely to turn to books and to receive a range of opinions from experts
who are not on the scene. One consequence is an ineffectual parent with little
faith in their own natural authority.</span>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='line-height: normal'>
        <span lang="EN-US"
            style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'>&quot;They are
taught to discuss with their child,&quot; says Patricia Edgar. &quot;You can
get into incredible negotiations with two, three and five-year-olds. And as
soon as (children) see a weakness in the authority of their parent they start
chipping away at it.&quot; Don Edgar says reasonable limits give a child a
sense of security. &quot;It's obviously better for parents to listen to their
kids but it's gone too far.&quot;</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='line-height: normal'>
        <span lang="EN-US"
            style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'>Interestingly,
the Edgars observe an unwillingness to set limits for children as a phenomenon
that pervades all of society: marketing strategies target babies and toddlers
(TV series such as <i>Teletubbies</i> is one example); Bratz dolls sexualise
the play of little girls; computer games are devised to sell products rather
than to stimulate the creative capacities of the young and so on. In a
market-dominated era, children have become fair game. Patricia Edgar, who has
spent her working life developing nourishing media content for children, says
the overwhelming emphasis of the children's movies, TV series and computer
games being made today is whether the concept can generate profitable
merchandise. And yet the Edgars say that research and experience tell us that
what children need are stories that help them understand the world while
stimulating their imaginations. Children love computers, they say, so why not
develop computer games or activities with meaningful content that are still
fun?</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='line-height: normal'>
        <span lang="EN-US"
            style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'>The Edgars take
the same pragmatic approach to child care. They say the argument about
preschool centres should not be about whether they should exist at all. (They
accept that working mothers are a vital part of Australian life now.) Instead
they put the case for better quality care. Early childhood development research
tells us these years are vital, so why not better train child-care staff and
fund centres so they can provide an optimal environment for young children?</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='line-height: normal'>
        <span lang="EN-US"
            style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'>A parallel
concern is the education divide. More than ever, the wealth and education
levels of parents determines the educational outcomes of their children. Don
Edgar says he hopes the Federal Labor Government's &quot;education
revolution&quot; will &quot;look at education right across the board in terms
of developing the best quality of education for children&quot;.</span>

            style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'>&quot;There is
rhetoric about children being our future,&quot; he says, &quot;but it's
becoming an economic issue, about investing in kids. There is not so much talk
about the quality of children's lives.&quot;</span>

            style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'>In an era when
family and community ties are weaker than ever, and when traditional religion
is in decline, society needs to think hard about the values it wants to impart
to children, the Edgars say. <i>The New Child</i> is a call for adults to think
harder about the generation they are creating.</span>
