<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Advocating for Victoria's children</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Don Edgar August,
2012</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The Victorian Children's Council has asked
me to put together a broad statement on the changing nature of Australian
childhood and factors likely to affect future children's and family policy. This
should be regarded as a 'Discussion Starter' only, not as a definitive policy
document or framework for children's policy. The views expressed are mine and
do not reflect any collective view of the Victorian Children's Council.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As the founding Director of the Australian
Institute of Family Studies, I have written extensively on the need for better social
policies for children and families, including a recent book co-authored with my
wife. (<i>The New Child: In search of smarter grown-ups, </i>2010) I must point
out also, that Victoria already has a number of excellent policy statements and
initiatives aimed at ensuring the optimal development of our children and my
central plea is for these extant initiatives to be integrated and properly
implemented. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Existing policy documents include the PCAC Report
(Premier's Children's Advisory Committee) of 2007 which led to the creation of
an Office for Children, a Minister for Children and a new Victorian Children's
Council; to the VCAMS framework (Victorian Child and Adolescent Monitoring
System) which already produces a range of Child Outcomes Bulletins; to the
State of Victoria's Children Annual Reports; to the many reports to Government
from the Victorian Children's Council itself (ranging from place-based strategies
to school transition for the disabled); to the initiatives already taken by the
Department of Early Child Development and Education, particularly the Framework
for Early Childhood Development produced for the Victorian Curriculum
Assessment Board and DEECD's new 2012-16 Strategy; and to the recent Child
Protection Report for the Minister for Human Services.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Victoria also has a range of existing
services aimed at optimizing child development and education - Maternal &amp;
Child Health, Best Start, increasing access to child care centres and
kindergartens, a new Early Childhood Development &amp; Learning Framework 0-8, plus
a range of family support services for those in need.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In addition, there are many public
advocates for children whose work should not be ignored. These include Children
First, Early Childhood Australia, ARACY, AIFS, HREOC, NAPCAN, Australian
Community Children's Services, OzChild, Playgroup Victoria and the various
State Children's Commissioners. UNICEF's Child-Friendly Cities initiative has
made its mark, particularly in the City of Bendigo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Victoria has a wealth of publicly available
data on its children and families; the problem is that it is not used
effectively, or it is forgotten when policy decisions are being made. Despite
years of rhetoric about 'whole-of-government' approaches and better
'co-ordination' of programs, we still fail to link up what is done by different
departmental 'silos' or even to see that what is done in areas such as urban
planning, the labor market, public transport or even health have a major impact
on the wellbeing and proper development of children. The system is, in my view,
too 'top-down', with 'one-size-fits-all' approaches ignoring the very diverse
nature of children's lives across what is a very 'patchwork' nation. Childhood
needs to be given higher priority at every policy level and public discussion
needs to try and regenerate the belief that children's wellbeing is the
responsibility of every citizen, not just of parents and professional 'carers'.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It should be obvious that 'children are our
future' but many adults seem interested only in their own future and little
concerned with what the future holds for today's children. That mantra assumes
a common underlying belief in Australia as 'us', 'our country', 'our legacy',
ignoring the primacy for most people of living in the now, pursuing their own
life satisfaction and letting the future take care of itself. It is a platitude
not always matched by action.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The changing way in which children are
viewed derives from a demographic shift and its impact on social values and
priorities. Australia's population of 22.3 million now comprises only 2.4
million families with dependent children and over 24.4% of our households
contain only one person. Young people are delaying marriage and child-bearing
to establish themselves in careers and prolong the single lifestyle, so
parenthood comes later, for fewer people, and they have fewer children than did
previous generations. Australia's birth rate at 1.93 is below replacement level,
and the number of childless women has increased from 27.6% in 1986 to 40.1% in
2006 (for women aged 40-44, it has increased from 9% to 15.1% childless). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This makes for a double-edged sword: those
with children value them highly, invest more heavily in their development and
education, while those without children see them as irrelevant and not their
responsibility. Childhood seems to have become privatized, not seen as a social
good, with responsibility resting largely on the parents. The community as a
whole has become less centered round children and families, with urban planning
often forgetful of the needs of children and much of the caring work handed
over to professional child carers, teachers and other service-providers. With
an ageing population (14% over age 65 and a doubling of those aged over 85)
policy focus in terms of spending is in danger of shifting away from investing
in the young to caring for the elderly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Inequality has increased in Australian
society, with more people now living in poverty (2.2 million in 2011) and more
children living in areas of disadvantage in terms of their overall development.
The geographic clustering of families with young children makes for very
different policy issues from place to place, with outer suburbs and rural areas
severely disadvantaged in terms of resources, facilities and services which
could support parents in raising their children. There is an 'ecology' of
childhood that is too often ignored. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Vinson (2007) ranked localities by
disadvantage in his '<i>Dropping off the edge'</i> report in 2007, showing that
disadvantage is not just economic, but involves a multi-dimensional compounding
of factors such as 'place effects', lack of opportunities, weak social networks
and community social capital, gaps in various 'capabilities', direct social
exclusion from activities, community support services, the denial of any
'voice' in decision-making, and historical trauma for groups such as refugees
and Aboriginals. His indicators of locality-specific disadvantage include
social distress (as in housing), health issues, community safety, skills and
employment, plus education. The drift to private schooling exacerbates
educational inequality, opportunity and life outcomes for a majority of already
disadvantaged children. As the DEECD Strategic Plan 2012-16 puts it, school
performance (despite an increase of 44% in real spending on education since
2000) is 'flatlining', because of high regional variation in access to
services, increasing numbers of children who are developmentally vulnerable,
and the poorer outcomes of indigenous and lower SES students.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Anne Harding (2006) used ABS statistics to
examine the geographic 'clustering' of child disadvantage, defined in terms of
a range of 'social exclusion' measures. These include (for low income families)
: being in a sole-parent family, having no family member who has completed
secondary school, having parents in blue collar occupations, or no parent
employed, living in public housing, being in a government school, having no motor
vehicle available, having no computer in the home, and having one parent who is
non-English-speaking. This multi-faceted measure of social exclusion correlates
highly with the simpler measure of low income/poverty but goes beyond it to
show the multi-dimensional quality of disadvantage and social exclusion.  As
Argy (2007) sums it up, a child's class/family origins lead to educational
inequalities, which in turn lead to employment disadvantage and inequality. Without
increased resources targeted at state schools in disadvantaged areas, such
inequality will only increase.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The strength of these family status effects
could mean a degree of policy paralysis concerning childhood disadvantage and
wellbeing, because having a job, better parental education or being
separated/divorced are beyond any immediate government actions or services;
they must be addressed by macro-economic and nation-wide social policy measures
to reduce inequality, enhance family stability and improve children's
opportunities. However, we know that certain actions do make a difference in
terms of (i) preventing childhood disadvantage and its compounding effects (ii)
ensuring access to a range of family support services and improving the quality
of services already offered to assist all parents in bringing up children, such
as maternal health, child care, schools and local amenities (iii) providing
appropriate remedial/protection/family support services once problems have been
identified. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The Victorian DEECD Strategic Plan for
2012-16 identifies several of these potentially positive interventions:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Investing more in early childhood and home
learning environments; early intervention where there is vulnerability and
disengagement; treating education as a shared responsibility (between families,
learners, teachers and employers; insisting on higher standards in literacy and
numeracy; building a self-improving teaching profession; offering more choice
and diversity of pathways; sharing community assets for various purposes;
shifting the focus from 'care' to 'development'; and moving from central
bureaucratic micro-management to greater autonomy for schools and spending on
'frontline' services. The term 'engagement' seems to be central to this
proposed cultural shift, one that can only be achieved by increasing local
autonomy and control not just of schools but the whole range of family and
children's services. The Victorian Children's Council has long argued for this
sort of 'place-based' strategy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Advocacy on behalf of children can take
many forms. We can argue on the basis of children's rights - as the UN puts it,
every child's right to survival, to adequate development, health, nutrition and
protection, to policies and actions in their best interests, to
non-discrimination on the basis of gender or race, and to participation, a
voice in their own future. The rights approach has run into assertions that
Australian children already have good life conditions and such a framework would
undermine parental authority. Nonetheless, several States have effective Children's
Commissioners and the UNICEF framework for building Child-Friendly Cities has
gained traction (as in Bendigo) giving full voice to children and young people
without threatening parental authority.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Other advocates for children feel on safer
ground with an economic, cost-benefit argument: that we must invest in
children's education and healthy development in order to ensure ongoing
productivity and prosperity for Australia. This runs another risk - of favoring
too narrow and vocational a curriculum, with holistic development subordinated
to purely instrumental goals. In a rapidly changing digital world, it is not
even clear what sort of vocational education will be most effective in an
economic sense and how early in a child's schooling should such a focus be
imposed. Yet the flatlining of educational outcomes in recent years suggests
that money is not being invested in the right places or the right ways and
better results from what is already a huge investment expenditure on children's
education should be demanded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>More recently, research on the brain's
growth in the early years, its plasticity and the impact of adverse life
conditions such as family violence and lack of a stimulating environment have
gained some traction in arguing for more investment in early childhood
development, quality child care, kindergartens and a seamless transition to
formal schooling. Great Britain's Sure Start program was initiated and funded
as a result of the Chancellor of the Exchequer (i.e. UK's Treasury) recognizing
the clear cost-benefits of investing in early childhood development. Yet even
here the elephant in the room is the fact that most of that early development
takes place in the family and little can be done to alter the scenarios most
likely to damage children in the home. Interventions at the formal level are
seen as an invasion of privacy; while parental misreading of the research leads
to such excesses as  Baby Einstein videos and 'Tiger Mums' putting too much
pressure on children at an early age. As well, development does not stop at the
early years and ongoing investment is required at every stage of a child's
life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In Victoria, it should be noted that our
rhetoric about spending on the early years is not matched in real funding
terms.  DEECD tables given for numbers and costs for various sectors of the
'education market' show a clear discrepancy between the Plan's emphasis on
early childhood and actual spending at present :</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-US>School education $7469.3m  850,000
students =  $8787 per student</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-US>Higher education &amp; skills  $2437.7m  890,000
learners =  $2738 per learner</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-US>Early childhood developt  $507m 400,000
children =  $1267 per child</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-US>Operating &amp; support services $1133m   2,140,000
'clients'   =  $529 per 'client' in                                                        'education.'</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It should also be noted that the Victorian
Government spends $533 million per year on statutory child protection, yet only
$170 million on positive child and family support services. The question needs
to be asked, why are these services (mostly provided by contracted welfare
agencies outside the Department of Human Services) not made more accountable
for the fact that 70% of children have been reported previously; 2000 children
were the subject of more than 10 reports; and the rate for Aboriginal children
is 221 per 1000 (i.e. 27%) compared with the overall rate for Victorian
children of 32.7 per 1000 (3%)? Such children are not in fact being protected,
but the money continues to be allocated for 'child protection'.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Whatever our approach to child advocacy may
be we cannot move forward without better understanding of the social changes
affecting children in families and their importance to the wider community.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There are three main points to be made
about children in Australia (and Victoria) today:</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Most of them are in good health, living
     with both parents and being well cared for and educated, yet most of our
     attention (rightly) focuses on the minority who are not.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Life is increasingly uncertain for
     children and their parents in what is being called a 'patchwork economy'
     or a 'two-speed economy'. Such slogans obscure the main point about child
     wellbeing - that family life is not continuously stable, it is subject to
     'chance' events (such as loss of a job and income, divorce, illness,
     accidents and sudden disability) that can affect any level of society and
     we should not label particular groups (ATSI, sole-parent, ethnic, the
     unemployed) as always being more 'vulnerable' than others. Every family is
     subject to such risks and we must avoid using broad 'risk factors' as
     categories that lock some groups into an inferior status.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The prevailing culture of post-modern
     relativism makes it difficult to socialize children into any 'core' values
     such as respect for others, social reciprocity, responsibility for one's
     own actions, self-control, notions of 'truth', 'justice' and 'goodness'.
     The so-called models for sound ethical behavior - political and church
     leaders, media and public opinion leaders - seem to have lost the way.
     (See Gardner, 2011)</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>That said, there are several trends which
can be identified in the demographics and the sociological literature which
mean family and community life for most children is different (not necessarily
worse) from what it was for previous generations of children. These include
(relevant statistics in <i>italics</i>):</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A greater diversity of family types.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Older age of parents at marriage and
     first parenthood (can mean greater economic stability, maturity, but
     higher expectations and work-related stress, child care issues).</span></li>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Family instability is a reality for many
     children. Though the divorce rate has leveled off in recent years, many
     children grow up in de facto, separated and step families, with the
     corollary of uncertain parenting, housing, schooling and neighborhood
     support. Conflict is known to damage children, but the ongoing instability
     which follows separation and divorce is even more damaging.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><i><span lang=EN-US>In 2010,
24,853 divorces (49.5%) involved children under age 18 (fewer than in 1990)</span></i></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Later age of parenthood means fewer
     children, thus fewer siblings to 'socialise' children and greater
     'preciousness' on the part of parents about children's performance and
     achievement. Over-protectiveness and indulgence seem to be growing issues.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Wide ethnic diversity across the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><i><span lang=EN-US>23.8% of all

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><i><span lang=EN-US>0.6% of
Victoria's population identifies as Indigenous (approx. 30,000 people)</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><i><span lang=EN-US
style='line-height:115%'>Under our Skilled Migrant intake, there has been a
six-fold increase in Chinese over the past decade and a four-fold increase in
Indian migrants. They cluster in the main cities, 90% living in Sydney or
Melbourne, more Chinese in Sydney, more Indians in Melbourne. 43% of the
Indian-born are couple families with children, so are 38% of the Chinese. </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><i><span lang=EN-US
style='line-height:115%'>Skilled migrants have three times more higher degrees
compared with Australian-born, mostly in management, commerce, engineering and
technology. In the IT industry alone, 11% of all employees are Chinese, 14%
Indian and only 3% Australian-born. </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><i><span lang=EN-US
style='line-height:115%'>But the poorer groups of immigrants, from African
countries, from war zones such as the Sudan, Ethiopia, Lebanon, Iraq, Sri
Lanka, Afghanistan tend to cluster in certain suburbs, the outer west where
housing is cheaper but jobs harder to get, and both their education level and
language skills are poorer than the Chinese and Indians.. The ethnic mix in
some suburbs is volatile: Cabramatta for example 133 nationalities and 70
languages, with 31% born in Vietnam and 28% born in Australia. Springvale in
Melbourne's outer east comprises 21% Vietnamese, 29% Catholic and 29% Buddhist.</span></i></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Too much emphasis on 'self-esteem' and
     too little on 'self-control' add to the difficulty of socializing children
     to become cooperative members of the community; no society can exist or
     survive without compromise, cooperation and empathy. Too many children are
     'spoiled', expecting the world to revolve solely around them and their
     needs/wants.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><i><span lang=EN-US>The VCAMS
'Snapshot' 10.2 (June 2012) reports that 14.1% of Metropolitan and 16.0% of
Non-metro parents have concerns about their child's behavior, more for boys
(18.7%) than for girls (11.1%); 26.8% for Aboriginal children; 25% for those
living with only one parent; and more for the most disadvantaged (17.6%) than
for the least disadvantaged (11.9%).</span></i></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This throws more weight onto non-family
     members to 'handle' problem children, but it also means more of our
     attention should be focused on helping parents understand the new
     childhood and deal with it in sensible ways. Teachers, for example, can no
     longer simply protest that they are not 'social workers' and must
     concentrate on their 'real job of teaching'; they must actually face up to
     the social inadequacies children bring with them to school, and ensure the
     school acts as a conduit to better (more specialized) family support. Some
     schools in Victoria have already become 'Children's Hubs', linking a
     variety of family and children's support services through what is a
     universal access point - an approach that should apply to every school.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Higher education of women and societal
     demand for their skills in the workplace mean fewer children grow up with
     the mother as full-time carer. Much of the scare-mongering in this area is
     suspect, but it makes quality of child care an important issue, and
     sensible flexibility in the workplace (hours, leave arrangements, etc)
     vital to child welfare.</span></li>

     in terms of the 'work-family balance'. It's actually a 'see-saw' in that
     it bumps up and down as kids get older and parents' work situations
     change. No workplace can be truly 'family-friendly' unless it links into
     wider community-based family support services; nor can internal workplace
     rules about start/finish times or flexible hours/days make much difference
     if those other institutions involving children (child care, kindergartens,

     'child-centred' and less well disposed to spending on children, their
     education and well-being. Ageism can have a negative face.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Children are exposed from an early age to
     influences outside the family, especially the new media, leading to
     greater (pseudo?) sophistication, a blurring of the edges between
     childhood/adolescence/adulthood and a loosening of the 'authority' of
     parents, who become more like 'friends' of their offspring than adult
     monitors/disciplinarians. Concerns about media sex and violence are
     overstated as 'causes' of social dysfunction but certainly make childhood
     a very different experience and a challenge for parents.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The duration of childhood has been
     extended into 'adultescence', with prolonged years of education and
     financial dependency clashing with an earlier sexual maturity and a
     choice-based value system, driven by modern society's ethic of
     self-exploration, self-actualisation and consumerist self-indulgence.
     Large numbers of young adults stay on in the parental home, are less
     resilient/independent and influence other children's view of what 'growing
     up' means. </span></li>

 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The new media are 'over-blamed and
     over-claimed' for their impact on children and society. The truth lies in
     between and the key point to make is simply that they have changed the cultural
     landscape for children, and for everyone; they cannot be ignored and
     should be harnessed for their positive potential, not just vilified in a
     Luddite way.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In fact, the data show that most children
     do not spend excessive time on media use, they have 'real' friends,
     socialize and play outdoors as well. It's not either/or.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In seeking causes for the 'decline' in
     children's behavior and the quality of family life, it is perhaps too easy
     to forget the practical realities of life for many kids - unstable housing,
     inadequate incomes, poor quality food/diet, lack of public transport,
     playgrounds and other community facilities that take pressure off the
     family itself - all the 'supports' for families that those living in
     better-off circumstances take for granted. </span></li>

 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Scare-mongering has moved into blaming
     the new media for society's ills - bullying, school failure, obesity, etc
     - while the evidence contradicts the notion that watching TV or using the
     internet and social media is 'bad' for children. See my other paper <i>'Modern
     technology and childhood'</i> (2012)</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I am skeptical of the current push to
     diagnose 'mental health' as an issue for children. Much of what is decried
     is normal behavior, can be dealt with by parents, professional carers and
     teachers who understand 'the new child', and so-called 'treatment' is not
     evidence-based, labels children unnecessarily and distorts the extent of
     the 'problem'.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In sum, children today live in a world
where parents are older, siblings fewer, with increasing numbers of the aged
and 'solo' young adults who may not see children's needs as a social priority.
They also live in a society where income inequality and the private/public
school divide increasingly affect life chances and where market values permeate
family lifestyles and reflect consumer interests. None of this means today's
children are 'worse' than previous generations, but their socialization through
parenting, schooling and community are different. Many of our institutions
(such as schools and workplaces) are still based on assumptions about family
life that are outdated and new media technology has taken on a new role in the
social learning and development of children. Both policies and programs need to
take such changes into account if we are to ensure children's chances of
reaching competent adulthood are satisfied. </span></p>
