        <p><strong>Marketing to Children: a time-bomb.</strong></p>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Patricia Edgar</strong><strong>, 2008</strong></p>
    <p>The exploitation of children as a market is a global  phenomenon analogous to climate change in that the serious and costly  connections are not at first obvious. </p>
    <p>With climate change we have seen a drought here, a cyclone  in New Orleans, polar icecaps  melting, temperatures rising; all indicators of a fundamental problem which Sir  Nicholas Stern in his government commissioned report in the UK,  has judged as &ldquo;market failure on the greatest scale the world has seen&rdquo;. The  cost of environmental damage has not been factored into economic growth. We are  perilously close to a tipping point from which there may be no return. Inaction  will devastate the world's economies. The market's exploitation of children is  also resulting in a very serious cost from damage done to their health,  education and welfare which society will pay for dearly. Action now and  investment in prevention will pay us back many times.</p>
    <p>Children have become a lucrative global market during the  last two decades. In the US,  the marketing flagship for the Western world, budgets for advertising to  children under the age of 12 have risen from $100 million in 1983 to $16  billion in 2004. US children directly influenced the spending of up to $300  billion in 2000.&nbsp; Australia  Scan - a social research company - reports the 'tween' market in Australia,  which targets 7 to 13 year olds, is worth more than $10 billion.</p>
    <p>Over the same two decades obesity has become the single  biggest threat to child health in the Western world with juvenile diabetes at  record levels. Between 1985 and 1997 childhood overweight doubled and obesity  tripled among children and young people aged seven to 15 years.</p>
    <p>During the same period lifestyle magazines for 'tweens',  such as Barbie (1996), Total Girl (2002) and Disney Girl (2004) penetrated the  Australian market,&nbsp; initiating young  girls into the teenage world of fashion, sex and pop stars. These magazines  promote a culture that encourages consumption and the desire to look and behave  like adults. Child models pictured, posing like fashion models wearing trendy  clothing and make-up, are airbrushed to shop-window perfection creating the  illusion of flawless, precocious, premature adults to which unsuspecting  children aspire. </p>
    <p>This magazine culture is not about harmless dressing-up  which all kids love. This is big business, with ill-thought-through  consequences, part of a recipe contributing to future eating disorders and low  self-esteem among young girls, stemming from an obsession with appearance. The  Royal Children's Hospital (The Age December   3, 2006) has recorded a surge in the number of children under 14  with anorexia, treating more than 10 times the cases it handled in 2003. Some  of the children were aged 8 years. The Royal   Australasian College  of Surgeons reported (Nov 11th, The Age) teenagers with problem acne  are more likely to have suicidal thoughts. My generation fought against the  widespread use of images of women as sex objects, but thirty years on we are  seeing a much younger generation targeted, and softened up for exploitation,  both as consumers and sex victims.</p>
    <p>Australian research (Professor George Patton's Gatehouse  Study on Adolescent health published recently in the American Journal of Public  Health) has examined risk taking activities among school children in 26  schools. The study found: smoking, drinking, engaging in sexual intercourse and  drug taking are happening earlier and lasting longer. We are allowing the  promotion of a mismatch between biological maturation and social maturation  which is leading to mental and physical health problems for young people. </p>
    <p>Twenty years ago children were considered too small a market  to be profitable. Indeed the lack of advertising directed towards children was  seen by some television network players as a major reason why there should be  no children's programs at all. But in the interests of children, agreement was  reached between government, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and the public  that television networks had an obligation to educate and develop children as  well as entertain them. Australia  led the world with a regulatory model for the development of children's  television programming and advertising to them was within clearly defined  limits. What was then viewed as the beginning of a process of reform is now  seen as a golden age.</p>
    <p>It would be another decade before Disney heralded a changed  view of the profits to be made from the children's market. <em>The Little Mermaid</em> (1989) - the first new animated feature film from  Disney in 30 years - grossed an astonishing US $110 million at the US  box office and $222 million worldwide. Disney moved straight on to produce <em>Be</em><em>au</em><em>ty and  the Beast.</em> The Walt Disney Company reported a record profit of $1.4 billion  in 1992 demonstrating the revenue-raising potential of licensing, with  publishing, music, videos, games, along with any children's product that could  carry the logo. <em>The Lion King </em>exemplified  the Disney formula for success with fans spending $3 billion on associated  merchandise.</p>
    <p>The impact of this success story was felt globally. Soon we  saw marketing-driven television programs such as <em>Barney</em> in the United States, <em>Tellytubbies </em>in the United    Kingdom and the ABC's <em>Bananas in Pyjamas</em>. From then on, success in financing a children's  programme was largely based on character merchandising as a starting point.</p>
    <p>This fundamental change, which saw children identified as a  huge market to be tapped, coincided with the emergence in the 80's of cable and  pay television in competition with free-to-air broadcasting. Nickeleodeon, Fox,  The Cartoon Network and Disney cable channels competed for the child audience,  each with its distinct house style, aiming to dominate markets internationally  with their brands, their franchises and associated merchandising spin-offs.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Television,  magazines, fashion and fast food companies combined with phenomenally  successful marketing campaigns which tied together toys, clothing and 'junk  food' to sell a lifestyle to children. McDonald's was the star performer: its  golden arches become imprinted on children's brains for life. </p>
    <p>Nowhere is this partnership between food, fashion, and media  for kids more apparent and well integrated than when you go on-line. We have  barely begun to assess the scale of advertising to children there, much less  work out what we can or should do about it.</p>
    <p>ACMA, The Australian Communication and Media Authority, has  announced it will this year examine the impact of mainstream electronic media  on children's families and society including - free to air analog and digital  television, subscription television, portable audio  and video media players such as ipods and MP3 players, multimedia mobile  phones, internet-based communications and social activities such as instant  messaging, chat rooms, online gaming and the use and creation of user-generated  media. </p>
    <p>Such media include the immensely popular web video site  YouTube, which has come to&nbsp; public  attention with exposure of the DVD (distributed for sale and shown on YouTube)  produced by a group of Werribee schoolboys who are now under investigation by  the Victorian police for their filmed abuse of a young woman. The mixed  response to this video, among teenagers interviewed, reveals a confusion of  values in a society where even outrageous and criminal behaviour may be turned  into a commodity. </p>
    <p>The ACMA report 'will include a survey of parents'  behaviours and attitudes to find out how modern media help or hinder in dealing  with the pressures of family life. Most parents are not irresponsible, they want  the best for their children, but it seems they are unwitting allies in  assisting advertisers do their work targeting their sons and daughters.</p>
    <p>In the US  last year, the Kaiser Family Foundation released a study based on a national  survey of 1051 families on how kids' media-use helps parents cope. The report  revealed many children live in 'heavy media households' where TV is on  throughout the day, in the living room, the dining room and bedroom. One in  three children under 6 has a set in their bedroom. Television's presence in the  lives of many children is almost constant, while computers too are gaining in  status. Eight in 10 children six years old and under (78%) live in homes with a  computer and 67% had internet access from home: three in 10 households (29%)  have more than one computer. </p>
    <p>Another study by the Kaiser Family Foundation released in  July last year is the first analysis of on-line food advertising targeting  children directly. The research examined 77 corporate web sites (including 4000  web pages) with branded content likely to appeal to children aged 12 and under.  These sites are promoted on television and on product packages. The internet  has enabled creative new forms of marketing which draw attention to a brand in  a playful way over an extended period of time, and blur the line between  advertising and entertainment. New vocabulary is used to explain new  techniques.</p>
    <p>The study found 'advergaming' - on-line games in which a  company's product or brand characters are featured (an advertisement and a game  all in one) - on 73% of the web sites studied.&nbsp;  The sites (64%) also encourage 'viral marketing' where children are  being recruited as marketers to promote branded messages to their friends.  Promotions, downloads and media tie-ins proliferate. On-line advertising's  reach isn't as broad as that of television but it's much deeper. Children who  visit are exposed to a diverse and extensive array of brand-related information  far beyond anything they would see in a 30-second TV ad.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>On television, advertisers are required to insert commercial  separators, or breaks, before and after advertisements in shows intended for  children, yet on the internet, food and beverage advertisers are not  restricted. We don't know what children understand or do as a consequence of  exposure to brand messages in this new marketing environment. But with warning  signs becoming clearer - a significant increase in levels of obesity, the  juvenile diabetes epidemic and claims of corporate pedophilia in children's  fashion advertising - we need to know. </p>
    <p>In response to growing public concern the AANA (Australian  Association of National Advertisers) in October last year released its code to  self-regulate food and beverage advertising.&nbsp;  The code contains warm words claiming advertising &ldquo;shall not improperly  exploit children's imagination in ways which might <em>reasonably</em> be regarded as being based upon an intent to encourage  those children to consume what would be considered, <em>acting reasonably, </em>as excessive quantities of the product&rdquo; (my  italics).&nbsp; </p>
    <p>However the code applies only to individual advertisements  and does nothing to address the major problem with child-targeted marketing -  the huge volume. And children's lack of experience and cognitive ability makes  them susceptible to influence - even if the messages are honest, truthful,  clear and understandable - because children do  not understand advertising's persuasive intent.&nbsp;  The code is open to interpretation because  of the qualifying language used. Clarification is needed. </p>
    <p>Sophistry also bedevils the debate about the food industry's  role in the obesity epidemic. Studies released in October at the Obesity Forum  in Canberra put the cost of obesity  in children and adults last year at $21 billion dollars. It's not just the  amount of food we now eat in super-sized portions, but also what is in the food  - the saturated fats and the quantity of sugar - that make the battle to keep  weight within normal range a challenge for many people.</p>
    <p>The food and beverage industries insist we should exercise  more; the media industries insist it is not their problem, they only offer  entertainment. Government calls on parents to be the guardians of their  children: they can turn off the set, say no, refuse to buy, feed their children  healthy food. But business conspires against them. Marketers are way ahead of  the game as they bring the best minds to bear on ways to access and develop the  child market. The advertising industry insists it is responsible while it  pushes the boundaries with skilled campaigns, using sex increasingly, to sell  to young people.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>As we debate the pros and cons of regulation and parental  responsibility, exercise, fast food, children's fashion and sexuality - and  advertising's linking role in all things - we are losing the battle for quality  children's programs. The television industry worldwide has forsaken its  responsibility to children's development as marketing to them drives the  agenda. So children watch programs of inconsequence which consume their time,  when their sharp acquisitive brains should be stretched and stimulated. </p>
    <p>There is only one responsible answer and that is the  provision of children's programs must be an obligation on broadcasters and the  exploitation of children as a market should cease.&nbsp; We should revive the calls to develop a  knowledge nation. International research over the past decade reveals that if  children spend their early years in a compromised environment they are at risk.  For every dollar invested there will be a gain. Educated, engaged, healthy children  result in fewer teenage pregnancies, better school achievement, fewer  drop-outs, and a better employment record; 60% of 15 to 24 year olds who left  school before finishing Year 10 are unemployed.&nbsp;  The social costs of welfare, health and crime will reduce exponentially  with a community of educated, engaged young people. And obese, dumbed-down,  kids can't be expected to make the smart decisions required to solve global  problems.</p>
    <p>As with global warming there is a business case that can and  must be made for an integrated child policy, for their education, health and  development. The media have a central role to play and that is not as a conduit  for advertisers to reach a market with products. The media industries are now  at the centre of knowledge transfer. Programming for children remains an  essential part of their education. Parents, teachers and politicians will be  required to act on behalf of children as the negative effects of targeting them  as a market to be exploited become more apparent and the cost to society grows.  There will be a tipping point.</p>
