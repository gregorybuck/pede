    <p><strong>Challenging the Conventions of Work-Family Programs</strong></p>
    <p><strong>AHRI Conference Paper                                                        </strong><strong>22 May,   2001</strong><strong></strong></p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Dr. </strong><strong>Don Edgar</strong><strong> </strong></p>
    <p><strong><em>Corporate Work-Family Awards and good-news media stories about  family-friendly companies hide both the reality of most workplace cultures and  the changing nature of family life and its likely links to work practices. This  paper argues that most companies have not understood the business argument for  taking into account employees' family responsibilities; that the work-family  debate has been muddied by discussions of the work-life balance; and that  companies ignore the real demographic challenges they face in the coming  decades which will alter the nature of both work-family and work-life policies  and programs. The core issue is the growing diversity of the workforce and  competition to become an employer of choice. With younger recruits and  experienced workers adding their new values and demands to the design of work,  employers can no longer continue to pigeon-hole 'work-family' as a peripheral  business issue. They will need to become more active in encouraging a more  family-friendly environment, both within and outside the workplace.</em></strong></p>
    <p>I do not want to spend too much of my time in this address on  what work-family programs involve, how they developed, or what their  cost-benefits clearly are. I'll have to do a bit of that, just to set the  current situation in context and remind you of how far we have come. </p>
    <p>But I want to challenge some of the standard approaches to  work-family issues and get you thinking about the new challenges we face as we  move into a globalised, service economy and out of our protected national  cocoon.</p>
    <p><strong><u>Background  Introduction</u></strong></p>
    <p>We have come a long way since the days when outside life was  regarded as irrelevant except insofar as employees could be motivated by levels  of pay (the old industrial relations approach), </p>
    <p>During mid-century, the human relations school (Elton Mayo,  the Tavistock Clinic) discovered that there was such a thing as the informal  organisation which could damage productivity, and the social needs of employees  were in fact linked to how well they performed their roles at work. </p>
    <p>Then we started calling it Human Resource Management, with a  more strategic focus on catering for human needs, investing in people and  encouraging discretionary effort. But it was not really until the 1970s that  studies such as those of the Rapoports recognised the inevitable two-way link  between work and family and told employers they needed to assist people in  balancing their work and family responsibilities or they would suffer through  absenteeism, poor morale, stress and poor performance outcomes. </p>
    <p>You should all know what drove the work-family balance issue  as it stands today. It was the need for and the return of married women to the  paid labor force after the period of familism that followed World War 2. For a  short time in history, getting married and having kids was almost a universal  experience. The Baby Boom generation is the result. In those post-war years of  reconstruction, a depleted nation needed re-building, families needed to be  re-established and one paid job was enough to meet the needs of most ordinary families.  No en-suites or family rooms in those days, no four-wheel drives for Mum and  the kids, no dining out at fancy restaurants - life was fairly simple and needs  were basic.</p>
    <p>The way other nations handled the need for rebuilding is a  salutary reminder of things to come.</p>
    <p>Places like Sweden  had a clear philosophy about the future, about equality and about the  importance of early childhood. They recognised early that women had equal  rights, and that children needed the best possible early childhood care and  education if the nation was to rebuild successfully. Family responsibilities  had to be shared, in this case with the state, not necessarily by the husbands. </p>
    <p>Germany  and France, Italy  and other states had the same problems, but their conservative values meant  providing generous family allowances and little child care, the goal being to  keep women at home. Even today in Germany  schools close at noon, in France  at 3 pm, on the assumption that  mothers will be at home to care for them. Schools in Australia  are not particularly family-friendly either.</p>
    <p>In the USA,  marriage boomed and the Baby Boom followed, as it did across the western  world. But American women had had a taste of freedom and divorce numbers grew  as they asserted their right to work and not be the lackeys of men. Their  economy boomed, expectations about standard of living grew, people wanted more  than a two-bedroom home, the car industry revolutionised the cities, created  suburban life and boosted the consumerism that makes two income-earning adults  per family a necessity rather than an indulgence.</p>
    <p>What did not happen, however, was a commensurate change in  the structure of work. It has still not happened, and I guess that is the main  theme of my address today - despite the impact of communications and the global  economy, work is still designed on an industrial age male model and we are  ill-equipped to face the challenge of trends in our demographic makeup or in  the values that will impinge on the way future generations will live their  lives. </p>
    <p>Work-family balance is still a novelty tolerated on the edge  of those things still considered more important - profit, management control  and shareholder interest.</p>
    <p>Most jobs were designed on the model of family life that  characterised the bulk of the post-war population - Dad leaves home after  breakfast, Mum stays at home, delivers the kids to school, cleans house, cooks  the meals and welcomes Dad home again after his evening commute. Work was done  away from home, and it was designed to fit a routine time structure, with fixed  daily work hours and the weekend devoted to church and family. Dads were the  earners, that was how they cared for their family. If a woman wanted a job, she  had to fit in to that 9 to 5, or 8 to 6 pattern. It was her problem, their private  family problem, if the kids had to be driven to child care, or they got sick  and couldn't go to school, or the husband complained because his dinner wasn't  on the table when he got home just after her. Her earnings were welcome, but  she had to carry the load, not usually him, and certainly not the employer. </p>
    <p>Work was designed for men, careers were structured for men,  pay rates were set for men, and the women just had to fit in as best they could  if they wanted to work in a male world. Family life might be addressed as an  issue, but only because it hindered work productivity.</p>
    <p>It all sounds so unrealistic, so stupid in retrospect, I  marvel that the system functioned at all. But then I look at what still happens  and I realise we're all pretty stupid still. At least by the 1990s we had  recognised the problem was one of balancing or juggling responsibilities. You  had obligations at work, to perform and be productive, but you also had  responsibilities at home, to your partner, your kids, maybe even to other relatives. </p>
    <p>By 1991 Australia  had ratified the International Labor Organisation's Convention 156 on Workers  with Family Responsibilities. This was driven by the inevitable return of  married women to paid work. They were better educated, older at age of marriage  and older when they first gave birth, so their attachment to paid work was much  more than casual. </p>
    <p>Australia  was ahead of many other countries in legislating for equal opportunity,  affirmative action and anti-discrimination, but it is true to say that most  work-family policies in the 1990s were seen as 'women's issues' and not  particularly relevant to men. Too many workplaces implemented work-family  arrangements that were program-specific while barely touching the dominant male  culture of the workplace itself. And it is only in the last few years that  governments have begun to acknowledge that we face a pool of employees who have  very different family circumstances and very different social values from those  on which most work-family programs have been based. </p>
    <p>Employers and managers have to realise that the nexus  between work and family has changed forever. </p>
    <p>More couples with children are both in paid work; the  marriage rate and birth rate are down, with one in every five households now a  single person household; divorce has increased by 300% since the 1960s;  employees report high stress levels and lack of time for loved ones; and  companies are seeing the fallout in lack of commitment and high staff turnover.</p>
    <p>Now more than ever, we need women in the paid workforce. Our  birthrate is down to 1.74, immigration is restricted, there are not enough new  entrants into the labor force to drive the new economy, certainly not enough  new male entrants, yet we still have employers who think women wanting jobs on  their own terms are a damn nuisance. Moreover, we still have employers who are  reluctant to employ anyone over the age of 45, yet these are our most skilled  and experienced people and those over 45 will comprise a third of our workforce  by 2005. Worldwide, mothers comprise 32.1% of the paid labor force, their  participation rate rising from 48.3% in 1973 for OECD countries to 61.6% in  1993. </p>
    <p>The labor pool has changed forever and in a competitive  global environment no-one can afford to ignore where most of the talent lies.  If an employer cannot handle diversity then they may as well give up now, the  world won't wait for their troglodyte attitudes to catch up.<br />
        <br />
        Not to put too fine a point on it, business has finally  recognised that workers do have a life outside the office, and (very  reluctantly) that the new employee is in a position of power to negotiate  his/her own time, place and conditions of work. </p>
    <p><strong><u>A Dozen Challenges  on Work-Family Issues</u></strong></p>
    <p>This leads me to offer a list of what I see as the most  significant changes in the nature and meaning of the work-family issue for your  consideration. There are twelve points to make, but I won't elaborate on all of  them, in the interests of time. The paper will be available on disk after the  conference.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
        <li>First, I think work-family <strong>balance </strong>is the wrong term. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Life is never in balance, a state of equilibrium, it's  always a rocky road, with one extreme or another to handle. When you're young  and single, working long hours is fun, you have your mates in a common enterprise,  you work hard, play hard. Once you have kids, there are other demands, the boss  cannot take precedence or the marriage is on the rocks. Ironically, it is  married people who actually work the longest hours and earn the highest income,  they have that incentive to do the best by their families. If there's a new  contract on the way, or a report to be written, the notion of balance is  absurd, you just do it and let other things go, until you can slow down again  and think about other things. </p>
    <p>Indeed, why would we want equilibrium, balance, in a rapidly  changing economy? We live in a risk society and we have to learn to manage  risk, welcome creative destruction in our corporations and businesses if they  are to keep up with the challenges from a global economy. As Daniel Akst wrote  in the New York Times recently, 'balance doesn't build businesses, cure  diseases or change the direction of history … It takes a kind of mad genius to  reach some goals - a kind of unbalance that has somehow fallen into disrepute. Fortunately,  workaholics are still with us. … For what is genius, I ask you, but the  capacity to be obsessed?'  </p>
    <p>Ellen Galinsky suggests we use the word '<strong>navigating</strong>' instead of balance - we  navigate work demands and outside life/family demands, we don't balance or  juggle them like a circus clown. Navigate is a better word because it suggests  an ongoing process, not an ideal state; it acknowledges the fluid interchanges  between individuals, their families, work and community interests instead of  treating them as separate spheres. To navigate implies you have to be well  attuned to your surroundings, watching for obstacles, staying on course; and  you don't have to do it alone, there's usually a team, a crew of people who  work together to keep the ship on course.</p>
    <p>However, I worry that the word navigate is also too passive.  It implies that the course is set, the shallows and storms are there for us to  avoid, and the ship belongs to someone else. It implies there is a clear  destination, that we know where we're going and someone has a map or chart to  follow. I don't think that is real in today's world. I'd like a more dynamic  term to describe what we do in making our arrangements between work and life  demands. </p>
    <p>The term I prefer is <strong>'negotiate</strong>'.  Negotiation is better than 'choice' because choices are never just there to be  chosen freely. There are many options in modern life, and the task is now much  harder than simply fitting into the clearly-defined role of male breadwinner,  female housewife, line manager or union organiser. The essence of modern life  is optionality, but the only way to survive is to negotiate your way towards  what you want, you don't just get what you choose. </p>
    <p>Sex has always had to be negotiated, but marriage once  conferred certain rights and obligations. Marriage today has to be negotiated  too, as has whether or not the wife will work outside the home, whether and  when you have children, who will manage their care, how the household will be  run. Through the various stages of life, you have to negotiate with bosses,  partners, children and others to get what you want. You negotiate your way  through alternate options. </p>
    <p>I like the term negotiate also because it suggests to me the  importance of <strong>power </strong>- if you don't  have power in any relationship - whether personal or workplace based, you have  less chance of living your life as you wish. Women know this is true, so do  workers who combine into unions to give them greater clout than acting as  individuals, but every employee has to negotiate life's options, bargain, trade  off one thing against another. And the result is not necessarily balance, it's  the best we can manage given our circumstances and our relative bargaining  power.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The second point I want to make is that I am <strong>somewhat sceptical about how much we have  advanced</strong> towards a culture in which family life and the quality of personal  life are treated as important, either in their own right, or as factors  contributing to job performance and productivity. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>I was in London  recently, at the Blair Government's International Worklife Summit. It was  supported by a group of top businessmen (Employers for Worklife Balance,  chaired by Peter Ellwood of Lloyds TSB) and by the Department for Education  &amp; Employment, but their whole focus was on proving the cost-benefits of  work-life programs and family-friendly workplaces. In fact, there is now so  much research on the cost-benefits that no-one need do much more, but the  employers remain unconvinced. For one thing they don't read the research, for  another they don't understand or ask their employees what actually are their  outside needs and responsibilities and how they spill over into job  performance, and even when they have work-life programs in place less than a  third bother to monitor or evaluate the effects on morale and performance. The  real problem is that British employers don't believe private family and life  concerns are their problem. Nor do they believe it is the government's job to  legislate for better leave arrangements or more flexible workplace practices. </p>
    <p>Scratch the surface in Australia  and you will find the same. The Summit degenerated into a glib presentation by  a few 'good' companies like IBM and PriceWaterhouse about what they do, but the  Minister took a hammering at the dinner from some senior executives and backed  off rapidly because an election seemed about to be called.</p>
    <p>In fact in the UK,  a third of employers were not even aware of the new parental leave regulations.  Few UK employers offer family leave arrangements; 65% of workers say they are  consulted on work-life balance matters, but 64% of workplaces fail to monitor  what is being done. The latent demand for more flexible and family-friendly  work practices is huge, yet the employers don't know and don't seem to care.  The 2000 Survey found a very low incidence of flexible work time practices  other than part-time and shift work. There are few facilities to help employees  balance family responsibilities with work demands, not even the provision of  information services about child and elder care. </p>
    <p>The survey found 35% of British employees would like a  compressed working week, a third would like to work from home, more men than  women want flexible work arrangements, and 55% of part-time workers do not want  full-time jobs, with a third of such men saying family demands make part-time  work better for them. There seems to be an ingrained hostility on the part of  employers to looking at the changed facts of life and the widespread need and  advantages of flexible, family-friendly workplace practices.</p>
    <p>In terms of best practice in work-family programs, the United    States is not much better. Despite the  constant stories of best practice family-friendly workplaces, only a minority  of American workers have access to any dependent care benefits; only 11% have access  to on-site or near-site child care; only 50% can take time off when a child is  sick; although some improvement is apparent in that 75% feel comfortable  bringing up personal and family issues with their supervisor.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>The  central issue is that of control</strong> - <strong>employee  control over the</strong> <strong>how, when and where  of work</strong> versus the employer's distrust of workers and the managers' fear of  losing control. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>As Peter Ellwood put it at the British Worklife Summit: 'The  key is, how to become an employer of choice, how to recruit, retain and  creatively deploy the best talent available. People need and demand control  over where, when and how they work. But trust is crucial. How do we redefine  the B2E contract when managers fear losing control? We need to build a corporate  culture of trust, flexibility, reliability and community of interests.' Again,  negotiation of the work-family, work-life balance is the burning issue, with  both sides standing to gain.<br />
        <br />
        So that is my third comment: '<em>presenteeism' </em><strong> </strong>is the enemy of real change - being seen  in the office and appearing to be working, even when, after a long day's work,  you're not being at all productive in the hours 5 to 7 pm and everyone would be  better off if you went home, saw the family, or went off to play squash and have  a beer. This sort of 'face-work' is absurd in the context of emphasising  quality performance, outcomes rather than inputs, yet employers and managers  still fail to get the message. </p>
    <p>If only employers would realise how counter-productive is a  long work hours culture, we might have less of the following sort of  relationship problem than we have at present -</p>
    <ol>
        <li>My fourth point is that <strong>we have been</strong> <strong>too  simple-minded and business-focused</strong> about the work-family nexus. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>What is now clear from the research, but pretty much ignored  in the Australian discussion about work and family, is that the 'spillover'  from work to home is much more frequent than the 'splashback' from home to  work. That is, work life is an important <strong>source </strong>of employees' personal problems at home which, in turn splash back into the  workplace, affecting both performance and   productivity. </p>
    <p>This means most workplaces have got it wrong. They have EAPs  (Employee Assistance programs) that address  personal problems, but fail to address and reduce the extent to which jobs  contribute to those problems. It's no use sending someone to marriage  counselling if the job demands very long hours or is totally unsympathetic when  a family crisis occurs. </p>
    <p>To put it crudely - 'It's the work, stupid…' It's not that family  life is the problem in isolation from the way work is structured.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Fifthly, the research also shows clearly and  repeatedly that job satisfaction, loyalty, commitment and performance are <strong>more influenced by</strong> <strong>workplace support</strong>, a culture of family-friendliness and  understanding (especially on the part of supervisors), good co-worker  relationships and job design flexibility than they are by earnings or by access  to specific benefits. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>So it's no use just setting up a few EAPs or separate  work-family programs. You must address the quality of the job, allow for  flexibility in the redesign of work so that employees can manage both sides of  their responsibilities, and develop a supportive workplace culture which  carries the message that life outside the workplace is valid, and significant  to the bottom line of the company. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sixth, as I suggested earlier<strong>, the discussion has to move on from women  and child care to</strong> <strong>a broader  definition of family life</strong>, and to some extent it has. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The most obvious change is the ageing of the population and  the fact that every employee has parents even if they never marry or have  children of their own. One in every five employees is already a member of the  'Sandwich Generation', both raising children and caring for elderly relatives.  In the USA in  1997, 25% of the labor force had provided elder care in the previous year, with  an average of 11 hours per week being spent on their elders, men equally with  women. Elder care used to be another job dumped on women, but no more. Divorce,  having both partners in paid work and the new demands of women have put paid to  that. She may look after her own parents, but she's not going to look after  his, and he is less likely to have sisters to dump elder care responsibilities  onto. In fact, a third of both male and female employees in the past year had  reduced their hours or taken time off in order to cope with aged care  responsibilities.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A seventh comment follows from the demographic  changes I've been talking about: <strong>the  work-family discussion has to consider what it now means to be an</strong> <strong>employer-of-choice, and the shift in  employees' values about the meaning of work</strong>. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Even the most traditional employers will be forced to change  because of the<strong> </strong>shift<strong> </strong>in values of<strong> the new</strong> <strong>S-Generation</strong>,  the Solo Singles who comprise nearly a third of our total population. Their  motto is in essence - 'I have a life outside work, and if you won't acknowledge  that, goodbye!' </p>
    <p>It's pretty obvious that life interests and needs change  over the life cycle, so one size won't fit all. Young graduates and the Solos  are not interested in child care, but flexibility and personal growth  opportunities figure large. </p>
    <p>As one single woman put it: &quot;I never married because I  have three pets at home that answer the same purpose as a husband. I have a dog  that growls every morning, a parrot that swears all afternoon, and a cat that  comes home late at night.' </p>
    <p>As the recent AIFS study on parenting shows, one in five  adults say they simply don't like children. (As one commented: 'I don't like  them. They scream, shit and want food.') Another quarter say they're just  &quot;too bloody old&quot; to have children, and the ABS projects that 28% of  those now in their child-bearing years will never marry and never have  children.  </p>
    <p>Why would, or should, such singles have any interest in  policies that call themselves 'work-family'?</p>
    <p>There is a resurgence in the search for meaning in what  seems to be an increasingly meaningless world, and I am reminded of Studs  Terkel's (1972) statement about work: </p>
    <p><em>'Work is about a  search for daily meaning as well as daily bread, for recognition as well as  cash, for astonishment rather than torpor; in short, for a sort of life rather  than a Monday-through-Friday sort of dying.' </em> </p>
    <p>The new question is not 'What are we doing today?' but  rather 'How are we doing today?' The new generation of employees values  autonomy and responsibility, they seek a sensible balance in their lives, want  jobs to offer them both career training growth and personal development  opportunities, and they have the power to negotiate actively for what they want  on the job. </p>
    <p>There is plenty of evidence of this change in people's  values about work.</p>
    <p>A recent Queensland  survey of job-seekers found the most desirable job characteristics were: 81% a  happy work-life balance; 74% career development opportunities; 68% quality  leadership from the management team; 55% good corporate ethics; and 48%  training opportunities in the job itself.</p>
    <p>The recent report on the '25 Best Employers to work for in  Australia' lists seven key factors: leadership by creative and unusual people;  job tasks that are demanding and meaningful; the culture and purpose of the  organisation; quality of life; relationships between employees and with bosses;  the overall salary compensation; and opportunities in the organisation to grow  and learn, to stretch one's capacities and limits.</p>
    <p>A Price Waterhouse survey of 2500 university students found  that most of them expect to work an average 47.1 hours a week; will stay 4  years with their first employer; 64% put balancing work and life as a top  priority and will choose an employer who values that balance, provides a good  starting point for personal career development, inspiring colleagues and a  competitive salary. For them work-family issues are not yet a priority, whereas  they see their next ten years as a time for personal development and growth.</p>
    <p>What this clearly suggests is that work-family programs are  not the answer on their own to being an employer of choice who can attract and  retain the best talent around and I shall return to this in a moment.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
        <li>My eighth point is that <strong>we have to avoid confusion between work-family programs and the notion  of work-life balance.</strong> </li>
    </ol>
    <p>While not everyone has a 'family' in the traditional sense,  some claim to have a dog that is family, or a goldfish, and everyone has  friends and relatives that can figure in family-like obligations. </p>
    <p>I prefer to reserve work-family as a term for those <em><u>family</u></em><u> <em>responsibilities you cannot avoid</em>.</u> As I argued in the  Australian Bulletin of Labour last September: </p>
    <p><em>&quot;A child cannot  be ignored; a parent with Alzheimer's cannot be left alone; a dissolving  marriage cannot but interfere with concentration and performance; a teenager  with a drug problem demands parental attention. In contrast, playing a game of  golf or two may be good for one's morale, but it is not an obligation as  such.&quot; </em></p>
    <p>Once the Singles do marry and have children, however, they  will want time to spend with their family, unlike the macho men of old; their  partners will be employed and will demand more equality in family tasks. Older  workers will not need child care, may need help in caring for their ageing  parents, but essentially will want time to pursue interests outside the  workplace. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>The real  issue</strong> for workplaces then (and this is my ninth point) <strong>is that of</strong> <strong>managing  diversity</strong> and thinking creatively about employees as whole people wanting  different things out of work, family and life in general at different stages of  their lives. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
        <li>My tenth point is that <strong>work-family programs are not, in and of themselves enough.</strong> In fact  I am suspicious of programs that barely touch the processes that make up what  we call the culture of the workplace - 'the way we do things around here'. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>One thing that's clear from the research is that work-life  programs are used more frequently by managers and professionals than by those  further down the pecking order. It's easier for them to take time off without  losing pay and this probably accounts for some of the cynicism about published  work-family policies in many workplaces. It's one thing to 'walk the talk';  it's quite another to have different conditions and  penalties for those without negotiating  power.</p>
    <p>The best examples of <strong>good  work-family practice</strong> involve a clear involvement of management, a complete  culture change that affects work processes and not just the implementation of  separate work-family programs. </p>
    <p>AMP won the top Corporate Work-Family Award in 1998 and  offers very flexible family-related   leave, family information services and a culture that does not make  workers feel guilty because they happen to have family obligations that intrude  on work hours every now and then. AMP sensibly monitors its results: they  reduced staff turnover from 20% to 13%; obtained a 90% return rate for women from  maternity leave through flexible work arrangements; and calculate it would have  cost them between $50-80,000 to find and train replacements for such women.  Lend Lease has benefited from increased morale and commitment  because of its flexible work options and its  encouragement of employees to take days off to help community organisations.  Minter Ellison has shown that even a law firm, with its billable hours,  male-dominated culture, can develop a family-friendly culture, offering  alternate career paths, information about child and elder care, a parental  network group. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
        <li> My  eleventh point is <strong>there are</strong> <strong>still</strong> <strong>obstacles to change</strong> as well. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>For example, Barbara Holmes's annual studies over a large  range of Australian workplaces showed that:            </p>
    <ol>
        <li>in 2000, 63% were confident that work-life  initiatives were progressing in their organisation, but 34% felt they could  improve and were not having the impact they would like, and 13% reported  backsliding, a losing of ground in corporate implementation of family-friendly  workplace practices.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
        <li>24% had observed increased staff turnover due to  a lack of flexibility and 43% reported increased turnover due to excessive  workload pressure</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
        <li>54% disagreed when asked did they believe the  company was doing all it could to help staff maintain a work-family balance</li>
    </ol>

        <li>55% had seen an increase in the average hours  worked by employees</li>
    </ol>

        <li>only 19% had conducted any evaluation of their  work-life, work-family strategies</li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Imagine any company not evaluating the effectiveness of new  technologies, new work processes designed to increase productivity. Quite  clearly many companies pay lip service to the work-family issue, but they can't  even be bothered finding out whether and how it makes a difference to either  morale or the bottom line.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>12<strong>. </strong>But my final  message (and this rounds out the full dozen) about work-family policies and  programs is that they cannot be left to employers and workplaces alone <strong>- they are a community matter</strong>. </p>
    <p>It doesn't matter how family-friendly an individual  workplace may be, if employees live in a community that is in itself  unsupportive of family life, of children, young people or old. If there are few  child care places, or little variety in the sort of child care provided, no one  employer can make up for that shortage. </p>
    <p>If the schools have no social workers, guidance officers, no  before- or after-school care arrangements, then how can any employer counteract  the problems of youth alienation, home-alone kids, behaviour problems that  splash back into the workplace in the form of employee stress, poor performance  and problems such as drugs and violence? When an employer finds over half of  their workforce are aged 45 plus, and have elder care responsibilities, what  are they to do? Let them all take days off, build aged care centres at the  workplace, provide home care nurses for their employees' parents? Not likely,  though some of that might be a good thing and not beyond the realms of  possibility.</p>
    <p>Instead, employers in the future will need to become more  active themselves in negotiating for a family-friendly environment. They can do  this in two ways.</p>
    <p>One is to become what I have called a 'New Links Workplace',  forging <u>external</u> <u>links</u> with all those agencies in the community  from which they draw their employees and lobbying them to develop better  services. They can assist local community organisations and schools with  management and accounting skills; they can help them apply for grants from  government and elsewhere; they can invite them into the workplace to offer  lunchtime seminars, workshops on topics of concern. </p>
    <p>They can forge links with other employers in the same  region, share resources and costs so the burden for family-friendly support  services does not fall unduly on them alone. </p>
    <p>They need also to develop the <u>internal links</u> within  their own workplace between occupational health and safety programs, skills  development workshops, equal opportunity and anti-discrimination schemes so  these are all seen as part of an overall work-family policy rather than as  separate and unrelated programs. The holistic approach needs to apply not just  to the way the individual employee is viewed, but also to the all-embracing  culture of the workplace itself.</p>
    <p>The second way is an extension of the above. It will  manifest itself soon as a <strong>backlash by  employers</strong> against a government which urges them to be philanthropic, to  accept their 'reciprocal obligations' and act as good corporate citizens.  Employers do have reciprocal obligations, and the more sensible of them do act  as good corporate citizens. </p>
    <p>But it is the government's primary role, not the employer's,  to ensure that adequate community services and resources exist to support  diverse families with their diverse needs and responsibilities. That's what we  all pay taxes for, including the companies that do pay tax. Indeed, one could  argue that paying due tax is the main obligation of corporations and then it is  the government's obligation to ensure that taxes are spent in ways that help  citizens carry out their private family obligations in ways that make them  productive workers as well as good carers. Unfortunately, the corporate world  has become so blinded by the dogma of the free market, of small government, of  user pays, that they are now cutting off their own nose to spite their face. No  company can thrive when employees live in a toxic community. No economy can  compete if its workers lack the supports that make for a balanced and caring  life. </p>
    <p>The New Links Workplace is one which accepts its obligation  to cater for diversity, to arrange work so that workers at a variety of life  stages can function effectively both in their work and private lives; but it is  also one which sees itself as being in partnership with federal, state and  local government, in partnership with schools and non-government service  organisations to ensure a supportive community context in which productive work  can be pursued. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
    <p>To conclude then, in my view, the next phase of work-family,  work-life policies and programs will involve the forging of new alliances between  business and government, between workplaces and communities so that the old  dichotomy between work life and private family life will be exposed for the  falsity it always was. In a global age, where fixed roles have been made  obsolete and every individual has to negotiate their own life course, quality  of life can only be ensured through negotiated partnerships with others.  Workplaces are vital to the quality of community and family life, but so too  are communities vital to the quality of the workplace and the viability of the  economy as a whole. </p>
    <p>We need to rethink therefore the old approach to work and  family and bring it up to date with the new realities of a complex, constantly  changing and very challenging future.<br />
        <br />
        Work-family policies have to take a systemic, holistic  approach; they cannot be just scatter-gun benefits for individuals or they will  fail. They must sit within a broad-based philosophy of flexibility, within a  work culture that values the integrity of family life and rejects the old  hierarchical, long-hours culture that seems at present to be resurgent. </p>
    <p>They must be seen as a <strong>strategy</strong> to make the company an employer of choice, attracting the best workers no  matter what their sex, age, family type, race or value-system, and then, of  course, retaining them by letting workers themselves decide how they will  structure their lives so they meet both sides of their responsibilities.  Employers cannot do this unless they address the entire workplace culture, and  unless they address the community context in which their employees live their  complex lives.</p>
