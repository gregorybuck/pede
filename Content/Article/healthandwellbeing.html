            We have
            been taught to believe our health issues should be treated by health
            professionals. But for a healthy community to thrive, as we live much longer

            It was not

            By 2064,
            9.6 million of our population will be over 65; 1.9 million will be over 85.
            There will be more centenarians than babies born. In the main, they will not be
            frail and dependent because illness and decline are being delayed until the
            last few years of life. Recent research by the Australian Institute of Health
            &amp; Welfare shows men have gained an extra 3.9 years of disability-free life
            since 2003, women an extra 3 years. We are living longer and healthier lives,
            not just because medical science has improved but because the conditions for
            healthy living are better understood.

            Remaining
            healthy over a longer life does not simply depend on the latest drugs and
            medical technology. Ill-health can be socially induced. Social isolation, job
            insecurity, low wages and downward mobility don't make for a stable community
            or strong family relationships. Pessimism about the future breeds sadness,
            violence and indifference to social norms. For example, there is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/1.%09http:/www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(17)31363-6.pdf">

            </a>&nbsp;that
            35% of risk factors for dementia can be attributed to modifiable lifestyle
            conditions such as obesity (1%) and hypertension (2%), social isolation (2%)
            and depression (4%), failure to complete secondary education (8%) and hearing
            loss in mid life (9%).

            The most
            important keys to a longer life are not just genes, but education across the
            life course, a sense of purpose and positive social and personal relationships.
            These centre on work and family, both of which are undergoing radical
            transitions.

            Jobs are
            disappearing or being restructured. Current trends towards automation are
            resulting in serial part-time jobs, under- and un-employment. Work for many may
            not necessarily be paid work, though without an adequate income, poverty and
            social isolation can be damaging.

            By work we
            mean activity that is meaningful, that serves a wider purpose with an interest
            in the well-being of others. Voluntary and caring work are obvious examples. We
            know babysitting your grandchildren can lengthen your life by another five
            years. &nbsp;If we persist with the approach that treats those over fifty in
            the workplace as the first to be made redundant, view them as technologically
            incompetent, not worth retraining or even interviewing for a new job - we
            condemn future generations to despair.&nbsp; Such a community environment would
            be toxic and individual health would suffer.

            The

            Today, family-like relationships can take many forms – friendship groups,
            shared households, extended family households as young people stay longer in
            the parental home, lattice networks of formerly married, separated, divorced,
            remarried, stepfamilies whose links can be even richer than those of a small
            nuclear family. These new structures require us to adapt to new ways of living.

            &nbsp;makes the startling point that the life
            expectancy of America's white middle-aged has dropped for the first time in
            history. It's not because of obesity, diabetes or heart disease, but because of
            what he calls 'sadness', a loss of hope and a sense of personal responsibility
            and agency. The mortality rate for the least well-educated 45-55 year-olds rose
            by 22 per cent between 1999 and 2014, an effect, he says, of a learnt
            helplessness among the welfare-dependent, working classes.

            In
            Australia we may also have lost, as Vance claims America's poor have, some of
            that sense of personal responsibility for our own well-being, that sense of
            mutual obligation that binds a community together, the work ethic that drives
            achievement. These attributes are not only important for our individual health
            but for the wellbeing of the whole community. It is often the lack of hope that
            results in alcoholism and drug abuse, rising domestic violence and inter-ethnic
            distrust. Trends towards a self-centred, narcissistic culture, that the
            disadvantage of others is not our problem may go a long way to explain why it
            is claimed that so many are described as having a 'mental illness'.

            Better
            health will follow from a rethink of our systems of work and education, if we
            share more equitably the fruits of labour, access to lifelong education and
            retraining. We have to see improved urban planning for more integrated
            communities, solutions to the shortage of quality housing, better public
            transport to reduce stressful hours of unproductive commuting, a shared vision
            of caring for others and taking responsibility for how our actions impinge on

            major social changes in population age, family structures and the nature of
            work. It is not just young people, but also the middle-aged who are bearing the
