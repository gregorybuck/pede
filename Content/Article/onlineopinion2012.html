</span></div>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>As
residents of a country geographically isolated from European and American
culture, from where our history is drawn, it has always been vital for Australians
to travel to widen our knowledge, thinking, experience and understanding of the
world outside our shores. Modern communication technology may have made global
information more readily available but it has transformed the way we work and
made expatriate experience more likely and essential for innovation and
success. It’s no surprise that the Australian diaspora has grown so much over
recent decades.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>Both of
our working lives were transformed by the decision (way back in 1966) to study
overseas. Patricia would not have ended up founding the Australian Children’s
Television Foundation and shaping a children’s production industry that became
an international success; Don would not have become Foundation Director of the
federal government’s Australian Institute of Family Studies and developed
research studies that transformed our understanding of the Australian Family.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>We had
started as secondary school teachers with Arts degrees and Diplomas of
Education from the University of Melbourne. By 1966 we had married and had two
children, Don moving in to lecture in education at the new Secondary Teachers’
College, Patricia lecturing in adult education (teaching the first course on
women’s issues in Australia in 1966). Don had completed a Master’s thesis in
educational philosophy and sociology and wanted to go on to learn more in the
sociological field, but no Australian university offered sociology and certainly
gave no financial assistance or scholarships to a mature-age married student
with a family.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>So he
applied to the best U.S. schools and accepted an offer at Stanford University
where the top Harvard sociologists had recently defected and where the quality
of Stanford’s sociology faculty could not be bettered. It was our intention to
return to Australia after Don completed his PhD, yet opportunities opened up
and we took them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>The
Australian ‘diaspora’ at Stanford at that time comprised no more than a dozen
people who thrived in the intellectual community. Some returned while others
forged distinguished careers overseas. We loved the environment and spent an
exciting two years there with one child in the famous Bing Nursery School, and
the other enjoying her communal life in the safe haven of Escondido Village.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>However,
surviving on savings proved difficult and Don had to approach the Dean to ask
for a job or an abortive return was on our agenda. The Dean offered a position
at the Stanford Education Research Centre paying $300 a month plus all Don’s
fees. It wasn’t a fortune but we lived on it for the next two years. That meant
Don’s initial Fellowship was freed up to pay Patricia’s fees, as she too wanted
to study. She had always been interested in film so she enrolled in a Masters
degree in Communication, which included film and television production. The
courses transformed her life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>We
completed our degrees and Don was offered positions at several U.S.
Universities. Patricia was offered a job in public television at KQED in San
Francisco. When an offer to be an Assistant Professor and Research Associate
came from the University of Chicago it was too good to refuse. We moved to
Chicago, driving across country during the riotous Democratic Convention of
1969, with two kids and their grandparents in tow. So we were expatriates for
real. Patricia worked for the University of Chicago raising Ford Foundation
funds for a big research project training teaching teams to work in ghetto
schools.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>We
returned home for a number of reasons: we were paying tax in both countries;
Don was not enjoying his work in the Graduate School of Education; and we were
worried about the children in an environment where there was gang warfare.
Patricia did not want to return for she knew opportunities for her were much
greater in the U.S. but family ties were strong and after an offer to Don from
Monash University we returned to Melbourne.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>Our life
as expatriates thus lasted only three years but we see them as the best years
of our lives and they set the ground for the opportunities that came our way in
Australia. At first we were depressed by the passivity of the McMahon
Government, then enlivened by Gough Whitlam’s ‘It’s Time’ and the anti-Vietnam
campaigns. La Trobe University was setting up a School of Education and
Patricia called on the new Dean to ask about a job in The Centre for
Educational Media and Communication. She argued with the Dean about employment
conditions, but he offered her a position on trial for one year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>That move
set her on a career that had been unimaginable a few years earlier. She taught
the first university courses on film and television in an Australian
university, worked with Barry Jones and Philip Adams to get around visa exit
problems for Jerzy Toeplitz from Poland to head up the new Australian Film and
Television School (he came and taught in her La Trobe Media Centre for the
first year until the School was ready) then started both making films and
training students in film and television production, communication theory and
the use of educational media.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>As
virtually the only Australian with such experience and qualifications, and a
woman, she was appointed to the Australian Broadcasting Control Board by Dr
Moss Cass, sacked by Malcolm Fraser when he abolished the ABCB to set up the
Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, then (ironically) reappointed by Bruce
Gyngell to Chair the Committee on Children’s Program and Advertising Standards.
The details of these years are contained in her autobiography</span><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>&nbsp;<i>Bloodbath:
a memoir of Australian Television.</i>&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>That work led her to establish
(with the support of the Victorian Minister for the Arts Norman Lacy through
the Australian Education Council) the Australian Children’s Television
Foundation, which she directed for 20 years, winning numerous international
awards and selling programs such as</span><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>&nbsp;<i>Round the Twist</i>&nbsp;</span><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>around the
world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>In the
meantime Don started a new career teaching sociology, first at Monash, then at
La Trobe University. Having specialised in family studies while at Stanford
meant he was appointed as Foundation Director of the Australian Institute of
Family Studies in 1980, a position he held until 1993, becoming a member of the
International Union of Family Organisations, Secretary/Treasurer of the
Committee on Family Research of the International Sociological Association, a
member of the Council for International Year of the Family 1994, and more
recently of the Victorian Children’s Council.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white'><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:black'>Both of us
have an international network that derives from our time as students overseas.
Patricia chairs the World Summit Foundation on Media for Children; we both
continue to write and serve on various committees. That small Australian
diaspora we found at Stanford and then in Chicago has obviously widened over
the years, but had we not ventured abroad we may both have remained
schoolteachers rather than academics and policy-active leaders in our
respective fields. Coming ‘home’ had its problems at first, but we had
benefited greatly from that broadening of our horizons, and we hope, Australia
benefited as well.</span></p>
