<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Don Edgar</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Community attitudes to
children, young people and families</span></u></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Last week's federal budget
was quite revealing about the Government's priorities for children and
families. </span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>There was no mention of the
importance of the early years of childhood, of improving access to quality
child care and maternal health services. Fathers were, yet again, relegated to
second place as nurturers of their children with means-tested maternity leave
masquerading as a parental leave scheme. Single parents were denied any
increase in their living wage and the unemployed were dismissed with assertions
that their entitlements have already been boosted, even though one in every
eight children already live in jobless families. The environmental measures
being proposed were not framed in terms of ensuring a better future for our
children, nor was discussion about the budget deficit (other than by the
Opposition). It seems children were not even on the agenda.</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Small wonder that the recent <i>State
of the World's Mothers</i> report claims an alarming number of children are at
risk of failure in school because they are not getting the care and support
they need in their early years. </span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The question is, does the
community value families and children?</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>There are websites titled
'Hating children'; recent research suggests parents living with children have
very high depression rates compared with the childless; and there are sober
calls by population experts for us to limit the world's population to ensure a
better quality of life for those who already exist. Stay-at-home mothers have
lower status than employed mothers and are exhorted to work, yet our child care
systems and work-family practices remain in the dark ages.</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I think there is a real state
of confusion over the value of children because the place of children in
society has shifted under our feet.</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(Slide 1) </span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>What are the dominant values
of Australian society?</span></p>

<li>Individualism and hedonism vs. public good</li>

<li>Privatization vs. community
responsibility</li>

<li>Competition &amp; success vs.
cooperation &amp; shared destiny</li>

<li>Consumerism &amp; status vs.
sustainability &amp; self-sufficiency</li>

<li>Worklife vs. family life</li>

<li>Presentism vs. future impacts</li>

<li>Fatalism vs. sense of purpose</li>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>And how do such values affect
childhood and the task of raising children?</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(Slide 2)</span></p>



<li>Delays mean fewer (more precious)
children</li>

<li>Dividing lines between adult &amp;
child blurred</li>

<li>Lack of confidence in raising
children</li>

<li>Burden &amp; costs of children
resented cf. investment in future</li>

<li>New media gives children earlier
access to 'adult' knowledge</li>

<li> Market targets a 'segmented'
childhood'</li>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Parents are a shrinking
minority in the developed world and they feel under attack. They are in general
older, locked into privatized households in uncaring communities and workplaces
indifferent to their family responsibilities. They have chosen to have fewer
children, value them highly and lavish them with every possible advantage, but
they are confused about the impact children have on their careers and
lifestyles and about power and control in relation to their children, desperately
trying to be the ideal friendly parent raising perfect children on their own. </span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Their privatized family world
is circumscribed by two other forces affecting our values. </span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>First, the world of economic
rationalism with its values of commercial greed and consumerism puts company
profits and the individual first rather than communal belonging and well-being.
Self-gratification and sleaze dominate advertising and children have become a
huge and lucrative market.  </span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Second, such media-driven
values set norms of behavior for a growing group of young adults living a life
of self-exploration and excitement that makes them indifferent, even hostile,
to the needs of children and their parents but makes them a model for the life
to which younger children aspire. </span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>This group of Solos does not
identify with the mantra 'Children are our future' and often resent what they
see as the favoritism of family-friendly workplace programs or family-oriented
tax breaks. For them the present is what matters and gloomy predictions of
environmental or economic catastrophe simply confirm their view that children
have no future anyway, so enjoy life while you can. </span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Children are thus sexualized
earlier, ape the clothing and manners of the Solos, and resent being held back
by parents fearful for their wellbeing. Grown-ups are, in turn, frightened by
this new breed and moral panics about drinking, drugs and sex produce knee-jerk
policy responses. </span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The result is ironic – a
growing age gap between older parents and their offspring, but a narrowing of
behavioral norms, with 'youth' extending into the thirties and some parents
desperate to act as young as their children. </span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Fortunately there is a
groundswell of opinion that aims to redress these trends. Children's hubs,
integration of services around schools, the UNICEF-inspired Child-Friendly City
movement, the constant reminders from Richard Eckersley, the Australia
Institute and others that wellbeing and happiness do not stem from money alone,
and the current attempts to have Australia emulate the Canadian Index of
Wellbeing, all point in a more positive direction. ARACY of course consistently
raises issues about the needs of children and child wellbeing as a central goal
of policy, but it has its task cut out because an ageing population with a
minority who have been parents is likely to dominate the political scene, and
families with children are increasingly wedged between the Solos and the old.</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>My fear is that the power of
the consumer market, plus the increasingly minority status of children and
parents, will overwhelm initiatives such as the Australian National Development
Index unless there is a clearer political stance on the value of childhood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Think for a moment about the
language many of us still use and the dominant images - the Jungian archetypes
if you like – that influence the way childhood is seen today:</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(Slide 3)</span></p>



<li>Children as a private, not a
public good</li>

<li>Children as innocents in need of
protection</li>

<li>Children as passive victims, or as
a dangerous threat</li>

<li>Children as incompetents – train
for productivity</li>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We have effectively
privatized the family and the task of parenting, despite the fact that modern
society out-sources many of the tasks of raising children. </span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Childhood has been psychologised
and the sociology of childhood has been lost, a trend which de-contextualises
and de-politicises the process and makes the privatized family the cause of
failure instead of a community which should share responsibility for the
raising of future generations. </span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The key to ensuring the
wellbeing of all children is to reduce inequality and prevent family poverty;
all else is window-dressing. As documented  in the recent book <i><u>The Spirit
Level</u></i>, more equal societies almost always do better on every outcome that
matters to child wellbeing. We need not just more equitable incomes, but also policies
that foster people's 'capabilities to live meaningful lives'. That means
universal provision of parental leave, quality child care, quality children's
media programs, the best schools we can provide and, of course, access to
health services aimed at children and their families. Given that from birth to
age five, 85% of the brain's core is shaped, the conditions for healthy
development have to be in place.</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The problem is, our service
systems are rarely aimed at providing those conditions, or at reducing
inequality, just separate categorical services aimed at patching up the damage
caused by it. </span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We focus on changing faulty
or unsafe parenting behavior rather than creating a context in which doing
better as a parent is easier. A child-friendly community should be the goal,
not just kind and helpful parents.</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We pour millions of dollars
into one-on-one professional interventions and unevaluated 'child protection'
services when we know it's impossible to have enough dollars to cover every
problem. Even the language of prevention diverts us from the real aim of
providing the best possible conditions for positive child development. </span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Child protection, not family
support, dominates public spending, yet we fail to intervene early enough or
mount a concerted public campaign about sexuality or violence in the community.
The Rugby League group sex scandal may do that for us. Doubtless we are
preoccupied with sexual abuse because the concept of innocence denies childhood
sexuality and abuse is a judgment on the adult world. Yet guilt seems not to
extend to the world of advertising and child sexploitation. </span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The dividing line between
childhood and adulthood is now blurred and the initiation rites come earlier,
in more dangerous ways. </span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Perhaps we should drop the
myth of innocence and teach children resilience, because the world they face
will demand it. We should allow them to be the decision-makers they are capable
of being in their own right. As my 5 year old grandson put it, after I'd been
busily explaining some topic to him, “Yes, Don, I know that. You're not the
only one that knows something.” Moreover, if children have rights, then they
have responsibilities too, just as have adults. But talk of children's rights
is seen as another threat to adult power.</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>If we insist too much that
the goal of parenting and teaching is to produce competent adults, the
implication is that children are incompetent. We devalue their skills and competencies
as they are now with a future 'productivity' goal in mind. And we devalue the
experience of childhood itself, falling into the language of investment, future
productivity and preparation for adulthood rather than meeting children's needs
as they are in the present.</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The new archetype has to be
along the lines of children as a new but special minority, as real people, with
real brains, real emotions, real human needs that should be given room for
expression; of young people as competent, powerful, determined, even nasty and
in need of firm guidelines for conduct as citizens of the world. We must stop
treating children as precious little playthings, innocently frolicking in the
Froebelian  garden, and stop treating youth as naïve pre-adults, not capable of
exercising responsibility. Yes, they need to be children first, but they do
need to be prepared for life situations in ways we adults never had to
contemplate.</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We have to ask how best to
address the new media now so pervasive in their lives, and think about how our
wasteful legacy of a damaged physical environment will shape their lives, what
forms of education and new ways of thinking, changed values will need to be
inculcated in our schools, our media, our communities if they are to survive
and thrive. </span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Our approach must be tougher,
more realistic, more forward-looking, and more demanding of proper political
and social responses to the real and changing needs of children. And those
working for children have to come together with agreed values, within a
coherent, co-ordinated framework, not in an ineffective, fragmented way as at
present. A whole-of-government children's policy is needed, not piecemeal
actions by separate departments. Child policy as an afterthought is no longer
acceptable. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>What if we said:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Kids don't need protecting,
they need exposure to the realities of the world and education in how to cope
with those realities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Kids don't need just love and
nurturing, they need guidance and limit-setting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Kids don't need time to just
be themselves, they need experiences that teach them who and what they might
become.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Kids don't need praise for being
'smart', they need encouragement to further effort and how to achieve more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Nor do kids need
'self-esteem', they need a sense of competence based on actual achievement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Kids don't need just literacy
and numeracy, they need the skills required to make the world an ecologically
sustainable place in which equality is the goal of every policy and program.</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Kids need the chance to
develop every aspect of their potential intelligence to discover their unique
strengths and weaknesses.</span></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Kids don't need to be valued
simply in their own right, but valued as future citizens who will have to make
tricky decisions affecting everyone.</span></p>
