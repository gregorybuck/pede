        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>The film&nbsp;<i>The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel</i>, like
its predecessor, is already a resounding commercial success. And yet these are
films about old people. Yes, there is an increase in cinema attendance by viewers
over the age of 65, but these films attract audiences by telling stories that
resonate with profound and universal truths.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>The&nbsp;<i>Best Exotic Marigold Hotel</i>&nbsp;was about
reinvention in old age. A group of pensioners facing economic hardship at home
in Britain find online a retirement hotel in India and bravely decide to take
their chances on a new life abroad. The hotel is run down and run chaotically
–&nbsp;not what it was represented to be. But the oldies decide to make the
most of their predicament. They are not there to decline into passive
retirement and sit quietly taking their pills. They take charge, setting about
finding a purpose, through new jobs and new relationships, while exploring
their new world of Jaipur.</span>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>In the process, they rub off each other's edges, but they care and
look out for one another. The deep emotions we all feel through acceptance,
loss, grief, insecurity, death and rejection are woven into the characters'
experiences.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>The sequel focuses on our universal search for love and companionship&nbsp;that
does not diminish as we age. Each character seeks a friend who will become a
partner. The life lived in the Exotic Marigold Hotel is an exemplar of what the
Harvard Grant Study, begun in 1938, has found about longevity. Controlling for
variables such as income, ill health and divorce, those with a positive
attitude to life –&nbsp;those who see ageing as an opportunity to reinvent
themselves, who maintain relationships, and get on with the business of living
–&nbsp;actually do live longer, more successful and healthier lives.
&nbsp;Demography and genes do not fully determine our destiny.&nbsp;Lives can
change and get better, according to one's attitude to life and the effort we
make.&nbsp;</span>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>The sexual shenanigans among some of the characters in hotel -
from a coy developing friendship to one that is more raunch -&nbsp;&nbsp;make
an important point about ageing. It might come as a surprise to younger
generations who assume sex is an activity of the young, and that well before
old age, people become asexual.&nbsp;</span>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>In fact, we&nbsp;oldies are much like them. We
yearn for deep attachment and intimate love, just as they do; for conversation;
for company when we go out and when we come home at night. Yet, personal revelations
by old people about intimacy are treated as a bit of a joke. As Roger Angell, a
senior editor with&nbsp;<i>The New Yorker</i>&nbsp;wrote recently at the age of
93:&nbsp;&quot;I believe that everyone in the world wants to be with someone
else tonight, together in the dark, with the sweet warmth of a hip, or a foot,
or a bare expanse of a shoulder within reach. Those of us who have lost that
never lose the longing.&quot;</span>

        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>Denial of this fact is perpetuated by research that deliberately
excludes older adults from samples. The British National Survey of Sexual
Attitudes and Lifestyles,&nbsp; which provides an illustration of the sexual
practices of today's adults, samples only adults aged 18 to 44. The Australian
Study of health and Relationships did better last year, raising the upper end
of its sample age from 59 to 69, but still the fastest-growing segment of the
population is excluded.&nbsp;</span>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>The assumption behind such sampling is that those beyond 69 are
frail, incompetent, impotent and do not engage in sex. This is a myth that
needs correction.&nbsp;</span>

        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>Jane Ussher is the Professor of Women's Health Psychology at the
University of Western Sydney. Her research shows good sex is not the preserve
of the young. Of 602 women aged between 45 and 70 who participated in her
study, the majority were still sexually active. Even those with a chronic
illness will find ways to be intimate, including touching, masturbation,
kissing and hugging, as well as use of sex toys and lubrication. Indeed, many
couples reported that their sex life was better as a result.&nbsp;</span>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>Another researcher, Sue Malta,&nbsp; found older women aged 61 to
85 were just as likely to initiate new relationships on internet dating
websites as men of the same age. She discovered that relationships became
sexual quickly and for many women, they were more enjoyable than their previous
(mostly) long-term married experiences. Some participants had a series of
short-term relationships and others had multiple partners.&nbsp;</span>

        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>Some aged-care homes are rife with new-found love
affairs.&nbsp;Family members can be shocked and upset to find an ageing parent
cohabiting with a new partner.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>The value of intimate partnerships needs recognition, as they
bring health benefits including increased relaxation, decreased pain
sensitivity, improved cardiovascular health, lower levels of depression,
increased self-esteem, and better relationship satisfaction. They lead to
longer quality living.</span>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom: 9.6pt; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline'>
        <span style='font-family: "inherit","serif"; color: black'>Beyond food and housing, older adult needs and priorities are
regularly left out of national health, research and policy agendas. As we
debate the impact of longevity on the economy we need to study life in the
Exotic Marigold Hotel. Its occupants are role models for life in the prime of
old age.</span>
