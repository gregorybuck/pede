    <p><strong>International  volunteering: a no-risk approach to career transition.</strong><strong> </strong></p>

    <p><strong>Abstract: <em>In a  climate of misplaced panic about the ageing of </em></strong><strong><em>Australia</em></strong><strong><em>'s population, international volunteering can be seen as  one of several new approaches to social policy. </em></strong></p>
    <p><strong><em>Evidence  contradicts the common view that older people are or will be a burden on  society, a non-productive drain on the welfare services system, and shows their  huge economic and social contribution via income support to families, caring,  voluntary community work and active participation in the paid workforce. We  place volunteering on the international scene in a new light - as an  opportunity for those looking for career transitions (whether old or young) to  find meaningful work in a stimulating but low-risk environment. </em></strong></p>
    <p><strong><em>Harnessing the  life experience of those nearing or at retirement and extending the skills of  those in early or mid career are linked to the inherent benefits of  international volunteering. Leadership in a multicultural world is reliant upon  the attitudes and skills of an international outlook, the embracing of change  and diversity, language development and cross cultural awareness. </em></strong></p>
    <p><strong><em>New attitudes to  work as part of the life balance, a chance for self-development and social  contribution, give international volunteering a new significance for the next  century.  </em></strong></p>
