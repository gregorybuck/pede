        <h3>About this Title</h3>
        <p>Many workers are caught in a  spiral of longer hours, growing job insecurity, work stress and family  conflict. Many want to spend more time with their family but fear being labelled uncommitted.<br />
            The War  Over Work is a bold  and authoritative account of work patterns and the labour  market in Australia. As Edgar sees it, the future workplace is a battleground,  with struggles between corporate need and private greed, unions and employers,  men and women, old and young. The re-election of the Howard Government promises  to make these battles even more contested.<br />
            In this accessible and engaging  book Edgar argues that we cannot continue to focus narrowly on 'the work-family  balance' as though it can be achieved through simple programs within individual  Australian workplaces. The War Over Work  provides a blueprint for how we can win the war to get a life that works.</p>
