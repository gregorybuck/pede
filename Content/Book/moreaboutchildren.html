        <p><em>Children and Screen  Violence.</em>&nbsp; Queensland   University press 1977</p>
        <p>Reviewed in <em>The media  and Communications in </em><em>Australia</em><em>,</em> edited by Stuart Cunningham and Graeme Turner, Allen and Unwin 2006</p>
        <p>In Theoretical traditions Chapter 1, John Sinclair writes:</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Edgar offered the first ever post graduate course in media  and communication in an Australian University  at Latrobe in Melbourne.&nbsp; Her research combined orthodox field- survey  methodology from sociology with personality scales from psychology in a study  of adolescent responses to screen violence.&nbsp;  She notes the relative absence of Australian studies, but in her  literature review brings together a wide range of both British and US perspectives.&nbsp; These go far beyond conventional US  behaviourism.&nbsp;  In particular she critically evaluates the social or psychological  approach then fashionable on both sides of the Atlantic,  uses and gratifications, and seeks to fuse social science analysis with the  social construction of reality philosophy put forward by Berger and Luckmann - two European theorists living in America.&nbsp; She even takes into account British political  economy and Marxist ideological critique.&nbsp;  In her actual conduct of the research she combined the quantitative data  with the qualitative interview data reporting the adolescent responses to  particular films and programs as texts. </p>
        <p>All this may sound eclectic - that is borrowing freely from  here and there - but Edgar's selection of approaches is purposefully focused on  her research question and her treatment of the various influences is critical  not at all derivative.&nbsp; For these reasons <em>Children and Screen Violence</em> is an  early example of how Australian media and communication researchers were able  to inform themselves about relevant perspectives from elsewhere, reflect  critically upon them, then adapt and fuse them together so as to research  issues in our own and environment.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
