        <p><em>'I would regard </em><em>Patricia Edgar</em><em> as a sort of human tank.&nbsp; Patricia is a sort of Centurion in her  abilities to kick down doors and push walls over.&nbsp; She is annoying, irritating, relentless,  drives people mad, but she gets things done&hellip;'</em><br />

        <p><a name="OLE_LINK1" id="OLE_LINK1"></a>Patricia Edgar has been named one of the ten most influential  people in the development of Australian television production. Her candid  memoir is a provocative insider's look at the television industry and its  politics over 30 years.</p>
        <p>Dr Edgar was the first  Australian woman appointed to a national role in television regulation. As a  policy maker and regulator, she fought for more locally produced,  first-release children's drama on Australian television. Her take-no-prisoners  style won her great fans but also made her bitter enemies, particularly inside  the commercial networks and the ABC.</p>
        <p>In the early 1980s she  helped establish the Australian Children's Television Foundation. For 20 years  as its founding director, Dr Edgar spearheaded the creation of a celebrated  canon of children's television programs, including <em>Round the Twist</em>, which sold into more than 100 countries. Her work  brought her into close contact&mdash;and in some cases, conflict&mdash;with the likes of  Bruce Gyngell, Janet and Robert Holmes &agrave; Court,  Phillip Adams, Paddy Conroy, Simon Townsend, Jennifer Byrne, Galarrwuy and Mandawuy Yunupingu, Bob Ellis, Paul Jennings, and overseas with  senior executives from the BBC and Disney. </p>
        <p><em>Bloodbath</em> also tells Patricia Edgar's own story&mdash;of how a young girl from Mildura  became a leading innovator in children's television, and a voice to be reckoned  with in a tough business. In the fiftieth year of Australian television, this  is the media memoir of the year.</p>

        <p><strong><u>Preface to Bloodbath</u></strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This is a personal memoir about my role in Australian  television: a career which spanned thirty years, in an industry which is savage  when its commercial interests are challenged. I began in an era when women  found it difficult to have a say in educational institutions, government and  the media, without being ridiculed. Yet it was also a time when it was possible  to implement social change, when politicians and leaders would respond to ideas  for social change and I believed I could help build a better future. My roles  in the development of television policy, regulation and children's production  were part of a broad movement aimed at developing Australian culture - its  film, literature and arts generally - to showcase our country, its people and  its place in the world. The success of Australian content policy - despite  strong and vitriolic opposition - led to the building of an Australian film and  television production industry of world standing.</p>
        <p>This year 2006 marks fifty years of commercial television in  Australia. I  regard the late Bruce Gyngell, the presenter who  welcomed Australians to commercial TV in Channel 9's inaugural broadcast, as  one of my mentors in the industry. As chairman of the Australian Broadcasting  Tribunal, he gave me an opportunity that opened up ideas, friendships and  possibilities that fuelled me for the next twenty-five years. I once promised  Bruce, in the midst of yet another controversial moment in his own career, that  I would one day write the history of children's programming in Australia.</p>
        <p>But the main reason this book was written was the persistent  and gentle persuasion by my husband Don Edgar.  I was full of reasons why not: it would take too much time; I didn't want to  revisit painful periods in my life and didn't want any self justification for  events that were contentious. There were practical problems: I am a hoarder of  papers, but they would need to be sifted and put in order; I couldn't write  with psoriatic arthritis in my hands.</p>
        <p>And so it went on until we decided to clean out the  accumulation of forty-five years of our working lives. I rediscovered many  boxes of files in the roof space of our home, including five years of papers  covering all the meetings of the Children's Program Committee of the ABT held  in Gyngell's time there. The Tribunal had gone, along  with official records; my papers were the only surviving record. As I began to  read details I had long forgotten, I was surprised by the passion and conflict  that emerged from the pages. I relived the struggle to establish official  Standards that would promote quality Australian children's television  programming. </p>
        <p>It was my experience as chairman of the Children's Program  Committee that led me to the most significant role of my career, as founding Director&nbsp; of the  Australian Children's Television Foundation. Reading through my papers I  started to think of reasons I might write the whole story down. I remembered my  promise to Bruce Gyngell. And I reflected that the  quality of Australian children's television is now taken for granted. Those who  had had to fight for it and knew the history, were  dead or growing older and no longer in the public eye. I wanted to pay tribute  to the creative pioneers of the industry who were very close to me and no  longer with us - Frank Meaney, Garth Boomer and John  Morris, in particular.</p>
        <p>As often in my life, I was also provoked: this time by  gossip about events in my career that was misleading and inaccurate. I started  writing and I didn't stop. The more I wrote the more I saw the point of  writing. That I was at the centre of controversial events over a thirty year  history of the development of Australian television gave me a rough ride but it  was an extraordinary adventure. Don was right: it is a story worth relating  about an experiment that was unique in television history and has not been  documented before. Although this book is written in large  part about children and programming, it is also a story about the broader world  of television, in Australia and globally.</p>

            <td><p>The influence of marketers and    advertisers on our <strong>children</strong> is growing. And doing nothing will result    in catastrophic social and health consequences. <br />
                THE    exploitation of <strong>children</strong> as a market is a global phenomenon comparable    to climate change. The connections and their serious economic costs are not    yet obvious but the social wreckage is accumulating. <br />
                Sir    Nicholas Stern in his government-commissioned report in Britain last year said the    cost of environmental damage had not been factored into economic growth. The    market's exploitation of <strong>children</strong> is also resulting in huge costs,    measured in damage done to their health, education and welfare, for which    society will pay dearly. Action now and investment in prevention will pay us    back many times. <br />
                <strong>Children</strong> have become a lucrative global market over    the past two decades. In the US, the marketing    flagship for the Western world, budgets for <strong>advertising</strong> to <strong>children</strong> under 12 have risen from $US100 million in 1983 to    $16 billion in 2004. US <strong>children</strong> directly influenced the spending of    up to $300 billion in 2000. Social research company Australia Scan reports    that the &quot;tween&quot; market in Australia, which targets seven    to 13-year-olds, is worth more than $A10 billion. <br />
                Over    the same two decades obesity has become the single biggest threat to child    health in the Western world, with juvenile diabetes at record levels. Between    1985 and 1997 the number of overweight <strong>children</strong> doubled, and obesity    among young people aged seven to 15 tripled. <br />
                Meanwhile,    lifestyle magazines for &quot;tweens&quot;, such as    Barbie, Total Girl and Disney Girl , promote a    culture that encourages <strong>children</strong> to look and behave like adults. This    magazine culture is not about harmless dressing up, which all kids love. This    is big business, and part of a recipe for future eating disorders and low    self-esteem among young girls. The Royal <strong>Children's</strong> Hospital has    recorded a surge in the number of <strong>children</strong> under 14 with anorexia,    last year reportedly treating more than 10 times the cases it handled in    2003. Some of the <strong>children</strong> were eight years old. <br />
                The    Royal Australasian College of Surgeons last year    reported that teenagers with problem acne were more likely to have suicidal    thoughts. My generation fought against the widespread use of images of women    as sex objects, but 30 years on we are seeing a much younger generation    targeted, and softened up for exploitation. <br />
                Recent    research by George Patton, professor of adolescent health at Melbourne University, has examined    risk-taking activities among schoolchildren in 26 schools. The study found    that smoking, drinking, engaging in sexual intercourse and drug taking are    happening earlier and lasting longer. We are allowing the promotion of a    mismatch between biological maturation and social maturation, which is    leading to mental and physical health problems for young people. <br />
                Thirty    years ago, when I was the chair of the <strong>Children's</strong> Program Committee of    the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, <strong>children</strong> were considered too    small a market to be profitable. Agreement was reached between government,    the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and the public that <strong>television</strong> networks had an obligation to educate and develop <strong>children</strong> as well as    entertain them. Australia led the world with a    regulatory model for the development of <strong>children's</strong> <strong>television</strong> programming, and <strong>advertising</strong> to them was within clearly defined    limits. What was then viewed as the beginning of a process of reform is now    seen as a golden age. <br />
                A    decade later, The Little Mermaid (1989), the first new animated feature film    from Disney in 30 years, grossed an astonishing $US110 million at the US box office and $222    million worldwide - and ushered in the era of marketing to <strong>children</strong>. <br />
                Soon    we saw marketing-driven <strong>television</strong> programs such as Barney in the US, Tellytubbies    in Britain and the ABC's Bananas    in Pyjamas. From then on, success in financing a <strong>children's</strong> program was largely based on character merchandising as a starting point. <br />
                This    fundamental change, which saw <strong>children</strong> identified as a huge market to    be tapped, coincided with the emergence in the '80s of cable and pay <strong>television</strong> in competition with free-to-air broadcasting. Nickeleodeon,    Fox, the Cartoon Network and Disney cable channels competed for the child    audience. <strong>Television</strong>, magazines, fashion and fast-food companies    combined with phenomenally successful marketing campaigns that tied together    toys, clothing and &quot;junk food&quot; to sell a lifestyle to <strong>children</strong>.    McDonald's was the star performer: its golden arches become imprinted on <strong>children's</strong> brains for life. <br />
                But    nowhere is this partnership between food, fashion and <strong>media</strong> for kids    more apparent and well-integrated than when you go online. We have barely    begun to assess the scale of <strong>advertising</strong> to <strong>children</strong> there,    much less work out what we can or should do about it. The Australian    Communication and <strong>Media</strong> Authority has announced it will this year    examine the impact of electronic <strong>media</strong> on <strong>children's</strong> families    and society. <br />
                Last    year, the immensely popular, anarchic web video site YouTube    came to public attention with exposure of a DVD - distributed for sale and    shown on YouTube - produced by a group of Werribee schoolboys who are now under investigation by    the police for the filmed abuse of a young woman. The mixed response to this    video among teenagers interviewed reveals a confusion of values in a society    where even outrageous and criminal behaviour may be    turned into a commodity. <br />
                THE    authority's report will include a survey of parents' behaviours    and attitudes to find out how modern <strong>media</strong> help or hinder in dealing    with the pressures of family life. Most parents want the best for their <strong>children</strong>,    but it seems they are unwitting allies in helping advertisers do their work    targeting their sons and daughters. <br />
                In    the US last year, the Kaiser    Family Foundation released a study, based on a national survey of 1051    families, on how kids' <strong>media</strong> use helped parents cope. The report    revealed that many <strong>children</strong> lived in &quot;heavy <strong>media</strong> households&quot; where TV was on throughout the day, in the living room, the    dining room and bedroom. One in three <strong>children</strong> under six had a set in    their bedroom. Computers, too, were gaining in status. Nearly eight in 10 <strong>children</strong> six years old and under lived in homes with a computer and 67 per cent had    internet access from home: three in 10 households had more than one computer. <br />
                The    internet has enabled creative new forms of marketing that draw attention to a    brand in a playful way over an extended period of time, and blur the line    between <strong>advertising</strong> and entertainment. <br />
                Another    study by the Kaiser Family Foundation released in July last year was the    first analysis of online food <strong>advertising</strong> targeting <strong>children</strong> directly. The research examined 77 corporate websites (including 4000 web    pages) with branded content likely to appeal to <strong>children</strong> aged 12 and    under. These sites are promoted on <strong>television</strong> and on product packages. <br />
                The    study found &quot;advergaming&quot; - online games    featuring a company's product or brand characters (an advertisement and a    game all in one) - on 73 per cent of the websites studied. Sixty-four per    cent of sites also encouraged &quot;viral marketing&quot; where <strong>children</strong> were being recruited as marketers to promote branded messages to their    friends. Online <strong>advertising's</strong> reach isn't as broad as that of <strong>television</strong> but it is much deeper. <strong>Children</strong> who visit are exposed to a diverse and    extensive array of brand-related information far beyond anything they would    see in a 30-second TV ad. And, unlike on <strong>television</strong>, food and beverage    advertisers are not restricted on the internet. We don't know what <strong>children</strong> understand or do as a consequence of exposure to brand messages in this new    marketing environment. But with warning signs becoming clearer - a    significant increase in levels of obesity and juvenile diabetes, and claims    of &quot;corporate pedophilia&quot; in <strong>children's</strong> fashion <strong>advertising</strong> - we need to know. <br />
                In    response to growing public concern the Australian Association of National    Advertisers in October last year released its code to self-regulate food and    beverage <strong>advertising</strong>. The code contains warm words claiming <strong>advertising</strong> &quot;shall not improperly exploit <strong>children's</strong> imagination in ways    which might reasonably be regarded as being based upon an    intent to encourage those <strong>children</strong> to consume what would be    considered, acting reasonably, as excessive quantities of the product&quot;    (my italics). <br />
                However,    the code applies only to individual advertisements and does nothing to tackle    the major problem with child-targeted marketing - the huge volume. And <strong>children's</strong> lack of experience and cognitive ability makes them susceptible to influence    because <strong>children</strong> do not understand <strong>advertising's</strong> persuasive    intent. The code is open to interpretation because of the qualifying language    used. Clarification is needed. <br />
                Sophistry    also bedevils the debate about the food industry's role in the obesity    epidemic. Studies released in October at the Obesity Forum in Canberra put the cost of    obesity in <strong>children</strong> and adults last year at $A21 billion. It's not    just the amount of food we eat in super-sized portions, but also what is in    the food - the saturated fats and sugar - that make the battle to keep weight    within normal range a challenge for many people. <br />
                The food and beverage industries insist we should exercise more; the <strong>media</strong> insist it is not their problem (they only offer entertainment). Government    calls on parents to be the guardians of their <strong>children</strong>. But business    conspires against them. Marketers are way ahead of the game as they bring the    best minds to bear on ways to access and develop the child market. The <strong>advertising</strong> industry insists it is responsible while it pushes the boundaries with    skilled campaigns, increasingly using sex to sell to young people. <br />
                And amid all this debate we are losing the battle for quality <strong>children's</strong> programs. The <strong>television</strong> industry worldwide has forsaken its    responsibility to <strong>children's</strong> development, focusing instead on    marketing to them. So <strong>children</strong> watch programs of inconsequence that    consume their time, when their sharp acquisitive brains should be stretched    and stimulated. <br />
                There is only one responsible course: broadcasters must be obliged to provide <strong>children's</strong> programs, and the exploitation of <strong>children</strong> as a market should cease.    International research over the past decade reveals that if <strong>children</strong> spend their early years in a compromised environment they are at risk.    Conversely, educated, engaged, healthy <strong>children</strong> result in fewer    teenage pregnancies, better school achievement, fewer drop-outs, and a better    employment record. The social costs of welfare, health and crime will reduce    exponentially with a community of educated, engaged young people. And obese, dumbed-down, kids can't be expected to make the smart    decisions required to solve global problems. <br />
                As  with global warming there is a business case that can and must be made for an integrated child policy, covering education, health and development. The <strong>media</strong> have a central role to play and that is not as a conduit for advertisers to    reach a market with products. The <strong>media</strong> industries are now at the    centre of knowledge transfer, with much to offer <strong>children</strong>. Programming    remains an essential part of child education. This is sufficient reason for    government to effectively regulate and manage the Australian <strong>media</strong> industries. But ultimately parents, teachers and politicians will be required    to intervene on behalf of <strong>children</strong> to restrain the unethical market    practices we now tolerate. The effects on <strong>children</strong> and the cost to    society are growing. There will be a tipping point. <br />

        <p><strong>Extract from speech by </strong><strong>Patricia Edgar</strong><strong>, at the l</strong><strong>au</strong><strong>nch of <em>Bloodbath:  a memoir of Australian television</em></strong><br />
            <strong>26/9/06</strong><strong></strong></p>
        <p>Right now we are faced with  critical choices which will determine whether we sink deeper into a cultural  wasteland or step into the promised land of media opportunity. Will it be  simply more and more sludge for the mind, or genuine diversity of opinion,  debate and exposure to quality Australian content and the best cultural and  entertaining experiences from around the world?</p>
        <p>The outcome of the current media  ownership debate will make a difference.</p>
        <p>It took Paul  Keating five minutes on <em>Lateline</em> to articulate, in typical Keating style, a message the Labor opposition seems  unable to get across clearly. The proposed media ownership changes allowing  cross media ownership proposed by the Howard government are in no one's  interest except the current free to air networks, specifically the Nine  Network.&nbsp; Packer Jnr  can acquire Fairfax and voices of  critique in our system will be fewer and more conservative. The abuse media  proprietors can perpetrate on those they go after when you &ldquo;cross them up&rdquo;  (Keating's words) will be multiplied. I experienced that abuse when the <em>Bulletin</em> and the Nine Network set upon  me accusing me of a conflict of interest, apparently in order to force me to  resign from the Children's Program Committee (of the Australian Broadcasting  Tribunal). Equally the media can protect their own interests, protect their  friends and ensure cover ups more thoroughly.</p>
        <p>Eighty percent of Australians  believe there is too much concentration of ownership and in a democratic system  - the older I get the less sure I know what that means - but I think we should  be entitled to expect the potential offered by the new media landscape will be  developed for Australian benefit. It seems the media ownership policy is not  really about diversity and new opportunities at all. So is it about a past&nbsp; political deal -  a death bed pledge perhaps?</p>
        <p>Digital free-to air TV in Australia  is five years old but what have the Networks done with the opportunity they  were offered to deliver a new future? They have reacted like dinosaurs  squealing every time their financial interests are pricked. This has been true  since they protested against the ban on cigarette advertising in 1976; they  claimed they couldn't afford to pay for the introduction of colour  television and make Australian programs; their response to the children's  television standards was scandalous from licensees enjoying the commercial  benefits of a limited public resource - now they appear to have the Government  in their pocket on digital reform. The free-to-air networks have been protected  for 50 years in Australia.  They have been given every chance to adapt to a changing technical environment.  But they have not done so. </p>
        <p>So the ABC , with all its flaws  remains critically important. It is the most important cultural institution in Australia  and a most valued source of news and critical comment. The fact that it is  loathed by every government of the day means it has managed to retain an  independent voice under much hardship.</p>
        <p>The government is doing its best to  stack the Board with conservative thinkers in tune with their own ideology. The  funny thing is intelligent people can't always be guaranteed to do what you  want them to do. Witness Bruce Gyngell.</p>
        <p>According to Ken Inglis in his recently published history of the ABC the  current Chairman of the Board, John Howard's good friend Donald McDonald, is  admired within the ABC&nbsp;  particularly for his strategy in winning more funding for the ABC  within this recent budget.&nbsp; On the other  hand it may just be that it has finally dawned on the government that  destroying the ABC may not be in its best electoral interests. The ABC despite  its faults and they are considerable is all we  have. So we must express opinion on the ABC's performance to help those within  fulfill the role a public broadcaster should.</p>
        <p>When eventually the Australian  government opens up the electronic spectrum to large numbers of digital  channels the economies of production and the limits to the pool of talent will  mean that the need for the public broadcaster to maintain quality and diversity  in programming and maintain free debate in support of the values of a  democratic nation will be much greater.</p>
        <p>The ABC however is capable of  destroying itself. By dumbing down its content,  sacrificing innovation and depth for cheaper programming, pleas for funding can  be more easily ignored.&nbsp; Why should the  public pay for inconsequential junk?&nbsp; The  ABC is presented with a double bind which is no more strongly in evidence than  in its children's programming. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;In my experience it has been downhill all the  way with the ABC since the early 1990s. David Hill and Paddy Conroy were sent  on their way over sponsorship deals and the commercialization of the ABC.  Despite my issues with the ABC over its potential partnership with Nickeleodeon in the mid 90s - which I write about - there  were genuine efforts, under Hill and Conroy, to reinvigorate Australian drama  and children's programming through the independent industry</p>
        <p>Support&nbsp; for the Foundation's anthology series <em>Touch the Sun</em>, with its Emmy award  winning <em>Captain Johnno</em>,  ( only the second Emmy to be won by Australia);  support&nbsp; for the brilliant <em>Round the Twist</em> series and the early  childhood program <em>Lift-off</em>, which was  recognized worldwide as a ground breaking innovation for young children; came  from Paddy Conroy Head of ABC television. This creative partnership came to an  end with the ascension of Claire Henderson to  head children's programs.&nbsp; The ABC - our  public broadcaster - has become a leader in the game of licensing, transforming  children's programming into merchandise driven product for the very young. The  ABC continues to seek pre-school programming concepts with &ldquo;broad international  potential in respect of both television program sales and ancillary rights  exploitation&rdquo;( ABC's Release seeking program  submissions). Children are treated as a market - as consumers - rather than an audience  with special needs.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Why does it matter? Young children  are natural learners.&nbsp; Research confirms  the from birth to age 5 and in particular over the first three years of their  lives children learn and grow at the fastest rate they will grow in their  lifetime.&nbsp; Development is sequential. If  competence is not developed early then children's ability to develop new skills  as they grow older is compromised. <em>Lift-off</em> was based on that understanding from research. <em>Playschool</em> runs on the spot.&nbsp;  Young children like it.&nbsp; They like  anything - <em>Teletubbies</em><em>, Barney, Postman Pat, Thomas the Tank  Engine, Bob the Builder, High Five</em>. All sell brands to pre- schoolers.</p>
        <p>Which brings me  to the independent production industry.</p>
        <p>The debate about Australian  production has shifted ground in the past decade.&nbsp; It used to be about how we serve our audience.&nbsp; Now it's about what's in it for me - the  producer. What has happened to our stories - our films and our television?&nbsp; We have the stars - those we have bred  through local content regulation and a subsidized industry. But we don't seem  to have the vehicles to carry them. Did we give birth to an exceptional  generation who in the 70s fought for Australian content standards, subsidy for  local production, and then showed us what could be done with <em>Gallipoli, Sunday Too Far Away, My Brilliant  Career, Storm Boy, Picnic at Hanging Rock</em> etc. and a regular supply of  outstanding mini-series on television.&nbsp; Governments set up a Film Commission, a Film  Finance Corporation, Screen development organizations in every State, a  Children's Television Foundation. But the creative talent now seems in shorter  supply. Have they all gone to Hollywood?</p>
        <p>Peter Weir, Fred Schepisi, Phil Noyce, Bruce  Beresford were not freaks of their time. Phillip Adams,  Gil Brealey, John Morris, I and our cohorts did not  spend our time writing mission statements and when we went to talk to our  political leaders Don Dunstan, John Gorton, Norman  Lacy and others they responded. Some bureaucrats  were public servants - Cathy Santamaria and Tony Blunn among them. They helped. It was not easy but reform  was possible.</p>
        <p>I think structures become eroded  little by little. Keating reshaped the production industry making us more  accountable and there have been unpredicted consequences.&nbsp; Keating had in mind a creative nation, a  mature nation with our industrial, cultural and economic future tied together.  But in every area now we seek marketplace solutions.</p>
        <p>Deal makers have entered the  market-driven film and television business who  couldn't put a creative idea together in a lifetime - but they can get market  attachments - one reason why our films don't work as often as they might. As  well co-production deals have enabled overseas partners to exploit our subsidy  system and some local producers have been complicit in this abuse of our hard  won structures. In children's production merchandise has become the main driver  of program ideas along with the complacency of those who know how to work the  system.</p>
        <p>The Australian  Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) is  undertaking a review of media regulation for children over the next 12 months.  This review should be comprehensive.&nbsp; It  could be another chance to correct the system as the Television standards are  overdue for review. Kids are a jump ahead of broadcasters, teachers and  producers in their use of technology. Reform is not just about television  anymore. Any system of regulation has to be an ongoing process. We have to keep  at it.&nbsp; </p>
